			<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">After years of flying under the radar, taxpayers who hold Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and other cryptocurrencies are finally getting scrutinized by the IRS its time to come clean about taxes on cryptocurrency. The IRS has determined that cryptocurrency is here to stay and that the outrageous refunds that early adopters have enjoyed could be a massive windfall for government coffers.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">The tax agency has also figured out that many earliest adopters to late comers who are holders of crypto could owe a lot of money on these assets. The currency may be virtual, but to the IRS, the taxes that are due are all too real.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">Note &#8211; if you think you might owe back taxes on your crypto, we encourage all readers to contact us at </span><a href="http://bit.ly/2Hh7cEl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><span style="color: #0e101a;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://bit.ly/2Hh7cE</span>l</span></em></a><span style="color: #0e101a;">.

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">The Illusion of Anonymity</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">If you have been skating along under the veil of anonymity and failing to report your cryptocurrency holdings, you might want to rethink your strategy. After years of taking a mostly hands-off approach, the IRS is catching up in a big way. The agency is pulling out all the stops to recover the money the government believes is owed to them.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">Many holders of cryptocurrency are under the mistaken impression that their transactions are totally anonymous, and that there is no way for the IRS, or anyone else, to tell how much they hold or how they use their virtual coins. That may be a soothing fiction, but the reality is far different.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">The truth is that the IRS has a wide range of options at its disposal. From official form filings to subpoenas and legal documents, to pierce the veil of anonymity and find the real-world identities of cryptocurrency holders.</span></p>
<h5><strong><img class="alignright wp-image-4821" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IRS-form-1099-K-2020-300x158.png" alt="come clean about taxes on cryptocurrency- form 1099K" width="532" height="280" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IRS-form-1099-K-2020-300x158.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IRS-form-1099-K-2020-768x404.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IRS-form-1099-K-2020.png 1000w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IRS-form-1099-K-2020-700x368.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 532px) 100vw, 532px" />Did You Get a 1099-K? Well, So Did the IRS</strong></h5>
<p>In some cases, holders of cryptocurrency are finding tax forms in their mailboxes. If you receive this form, you can be sure the IRS received a copy as well.</p>
<p>When you file your taxes, an automatic matching program will compare the amount you claimed with the amount on these automatically generated forms. If there is a mismatch, you will hear from the IRS.</p>
<p>One of the most common forms used to report cryptocurrency holdings and transactions is the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/understanding-your-form-1099-k">1099-K</a>. For sellers on eBay and some freelancers, this form will already be familiar. Still, it is being extended into the virtual world as well. If you receive a 1099-K form this year, it is time to come clean with your cryptocurrency holdings.</p>
<h5><strong>The Cryptocurrency Question and Your Tax Form</strong></h5>
<p>Until now, cryptocurrency holders could and often did, plead ignorance. They could claim they did not realize their Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other virtual holdings were taxable. They could back up that assertion by saying the IRS never asked them about these assets. Time to come clean about taxes on cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>The validity of that excuse may have been questionable. Now that thin veil of supposed ignorance will be gone. Beginning with the 2019 tax return, taxpayers will be asked directly on their 1040 if they bought, sold, transacted, or otherwise acquired any cryptocurrency. They will be expected to answer that question truthfully.</p>
<p>The wording of this question means anyone who holds any cryptocurrency would be required to answer in the affirmative. Even so, merely holding virtual coins in a cryptocurrency wallet does not necessarily imply any taxes will be due. Someone who holds cryptocurrency but makes no transactions should not owe any taxes just as a holder of stock does not owe taxes until they sell the shares.</p>
<p>Come clean about taxes on cryptocurrency as the IRS is getting serious about cryptocurrency, drawn by a combination of past returns, unreported taxes, and increased exposure of these alternative forms of payment.</p>

			<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> I is for Innocent/Injured Spouse Relief &#8211; The Takeaway: When you file a joint return, you and your spouse share in the responsibility to pay the tax. The IRS can collect against each of you together or separately. This is called &#8220;joint ad several liability.&#8221; But what if the tax debt is not yours.</span></p>
<h5><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Diffe</span></strong><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">rences between Injured Spouse vs. Innocent Spouse</span></strong></h5>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Innocent spouse relief might be extended when your current or former spouse fails to report income, reported income improperly, or claimed improper deductions and credits. To qualify as an innocent spouse, the IRS says you must </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">meet all</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> of the following requirements:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">You filed a joint return that had an understatement of tax (deficiency) that’s wholly credited to your spouse’s erroneous item. Erroneous items include the income received by your spouse but omitted from the return, as well as incorrectly reported deductions, credits, and property basis.</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">You establish that when you signed the return that you didn’t know and had no reason to know, that there was an understatement of tax.</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Allowing for all pertinent facts, it would be unfair to hold you liable for the understatement of tax.</span></li>
</ul>
<h5><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In summary, an innocent spouse is married to someone who, on their joint tax return, deliberately lied to the federal government by hiding or misreporting income or claimed too many write-offs to lower their tax bill. </span></h5>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If you had no idea about this understatement at the time you signed your tax return form, the government doesn’t think you should be held accountable for the penalty. It might qualify you for innocent spouse relief from joint and several liability.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In contrast, an injured spouse is someone whose tax refund is used to cover the financial obligations of a current or former spouse. You would be an injured spouse if your share of the overpayment shown on your joint return was, or is expected to be, applied (offset) against your spouse’s legally enforceable past-due debts. To be considered an injured spouse, you must have paid federal income tax or claimed refundable tax credit, such as the Earned Income Credit or Additional Child Tax Credit on the joint return, and not be legally obligated to pay the debt of the spouse.</span></p>
<h5><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4825" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Injured-Spouse-vs-Innocent-Spouse-Relief-300x251.png" alt="I is for Injured/Innocent Spouse Relief" width="300" height="251" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Injured-Spouse-vs-Innocent-Spouse-Relief-300x251.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Injured-Spouse-vs-Innocent-Spouse-Relief-768x644.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Injured-Spouse-vs-Innocent-Spouse-Relief-700x587.png 700w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Injured-Spouse-vs-Innocent-Spouse-Relief.png 940w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Rules for Injured Spouse vs. Innocent Spouse</span></h5>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If you file a joint return with your spouse, the IRS will not automatically distinguish between you and your partner when collecting tax dollars from either of you, even if your spouse’s debt existed well before the marriage. The IRS has the legal right to offset some or all of a refund to apply to unpaid financial responsibilities such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Federal taxes</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">State income taxes</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">State unemployment compensation debts</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Child or spousal support payments</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Federal nontax debt, such as defaulted student loans</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">When the IRS applies a person’s refund to past liability, they will mail a formal Notice of Offset to the taxpayer’s address. At this time, the taxpayer whose refund was seized or offset has the opportunity to file an injured spouse claim. </span></p>
<h5><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> I is for Innocent/Injured Spouse Relief </span></h5>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Innocent spouses face more severe problems than injured spouses. When you complete a tax return, you sign your return with penalties under perjury. Even if you were unaware of your spouse’s understatement, the IRS counts this misrepresentation as tax fraud and imposes serious consequences for it. Legally, if the IRS suspects fraud in your joint return, the IRS can:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Impose Penalties and Fees</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Make Criminal Charges</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">For relief of liability from the above penalties, you can file an innocent spouse claim. The innocent spouse rule stipulates that you must have signed and filed a joint return without full knowledge of your spouse’s real financial situation. Married persons who did not file joint returns, but live in community property states, may also qualify for innocent spouse relief. </span></p>
<p>When deciding on the situation that is best for you, you need to make sure you know the differences between innocent and injured spouse as they are very different.</p>

			<p>Handing an IRS Audit &#8211; IRS audits are rare these days. State tax authorities also conduct audits. Sometimes tax audits are random, but the IRS usually selects taxpayers based on suspicious activity.</p>
<p>Most <a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/irs-audits">IRS audits</a> are done by mail and are much less intrusive than the dreaded audit where the taxpayer personally meets with the IRS at their office (called an &#8220;office&#8221; or &#8220;desk&#8221; audit) or at the taxpayer&#8217;s home or place of business (called a &#8220;field&#8221; audit). <a href="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs-tax-problem-solutions/the-sfs-team/">Working with us</a> means you generally do not speak or meet with the IRS.</p>
<p>The IRS audited almost 1.0 million tax returns, approximately 0.5 percent of all returns filed in Calendar Year 2017. Or 1 in 184 taxpayers were selected for audit. For taxpayers filing individual tax returns, the likelihood of audit is 1 in 161. <em> </em>Filing your return accurately and honestly can reduce your chances of being selected and increase the odds of a favorable outcome.</p>
<p><em>According to IRS statistics, people in higher tax brackets and people who report no income at all get the most attention. </em> Those earning more than $1 million were audited at a 4.4 percent rate. If you&#8217;re a high earner, know that you may hear from the IRS.</p>
<h4><img class="alignright wp-image-4778 size-medium" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Red-flag-and-audits-300x158.png" alt="Handling an IRS Audit -A sign that says Red Flag, ripped paper that says Audit and words saying - Audits are Rare." width="300" height="158" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Red-flag-and-audits-300x158.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Red-flag-and-audits-768x404.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Red-flag-and-audits.png 1000w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Red-flag-and-audits-700x368.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Here are thirteen of the biggest red flags that are likely to land you in the IRS audit radar.</h4>
<ol>
<li>You aren&#8217;t reporting cryptocurrency &#8211; When you buy something with cryptocurrency, it&#8217;s a taxable transaction. The IRS receives information from digital currency wallet Coinbase and may apply increased review to your tax return if it doesn&#8217;t reflect the data provided.</li>
<li>Failing to report all of your income &#8211; You may want to submit only your W-2 form from your primary job and keep the freelance job income on your Form 1099 to yourself. The IRS already knows about income that appears on your W-2 and1099 income forms because the company you worked for a submitted copy to the IRS. It&#8217;s only a matter of time before the IRS discovers your omission.</li>
<li>Claiming too many charitable contributions &#8211; Don&#8217;t report false donations. If you don&#8217;t have the proper documentation to prove the validity of your contribution, don&#8217;t claim it.</li>
<li>If you are self-employed &#8211; Business owners may attract additional review from the IRS. They tended to examine the returns of self-employed filers at higher rates than it did comparable non-business filers, according to IRS data. If you claim self-employment income and deductions through your individual income tax return, double-check your numbers and keep a paper trail to back up tax deductions.</li>
<li>Reporting too many losses on a Schedule C &#8211; This one is for the self-employed. If you are the boss, you might be inclined to hide income by taking personal expenses as business expenses. But before you do, consider the suspicion that too many reported losses could arouse.</li>
<li>Deducting too many business expenses &#8211; To be eligible as a deduction, purchases must be ordinary and necessary to your business.</li>
<li>Claiming a home office deduction &#8211; The IRS defines the home office deduction as reserved for people who use part of their home &#8220;exclusively and regularly for your trade or business.&#8221; That means a home office can qualify if you use it for work and work only.</li>
<li>Using round numbers &#8211; When making your calculations, be precise, and avoid making estimations. If the numbers all end in a double zero, it can look fishy.</li>
<li>Typos or math errors &#8211; It might be an honest mistake. Still, if something looks questionable, such as an incorrect Social Security number or calculations that don&#8217;t add up, you may bring on additional scrutiny from the IRS.</li>
<li>You have three consecutive years of business losses &#8211; For self-employed filers who have reported losses for three consecutive years, it does create a potential audit risk because the IRS will challenge that to see if it&#8217;s a business or it&#8217;s a hobby. A loss from a business is deductible; a hobby loss is not.</li>
<li>You deduct 100% of your car for business &#8211; When listing the business use of a work-related automobile, the IRS knows that it&#8217;s unlikely that you&#8217;re using it 100 percent for work. We recommend that clients use a mobile app to track mileage.</li>
<li>Mobile phone usage &#8211; unless you have a 2<sup>nd</sup> or 3<sup>rd</sup> mobile phone deducting 100% of the bill (which may include your spouse and children) will bring additional scrutiny.</li>

<li>It doesn&#8217;t make sense &#8211; If you&#8217;re claiming large deductions on a small salary, you could find yourself required to provide additional documentation from the IRS.</li>
</ol>
<p>As long as you file taxes accurately and keep good records, you shouldn&#8217;t fear a tax audit. If you&#8217;re concerned about your tax return or the paperwork involved, meet with a competent tax preparer and make sure you keep accurate records throughout the year.</p>

<p>How to Select a Reputable Tax Resolution Company to Permanently Resolve Your Tax Problems</p>
<p>Owing back taxes is difficult and stressful. The IRS and/or State taxing authorities have the power to garnish your paycheck and freeze your bank account in order to collect what they think is their money. The IRS is the most brutal collection agency on the planet. Calling the IRS is time consuming and annoying as hold times can be longer than 30 minutes and the information you receive from them may not be correct.</p>
<p>The <strong>good news</strong> is that there are legal tax solutions to ensure that you pay the minimum amount allowed by law based on your current financial situation.</p>
<p>How to Select a Tax Resolution Company &#8211; It is important to work with a skilled tax resolution professional because they know how to present your case, in your best interest, before the IRS. Financial information has to be presented accurately the first time around. Mistakes are very costly and, in some cases, doing the wrong things can be impossible to solve; doing things right the first time is essential. You don’t get a second chance with the IRS.</p>
<p><strong>1. How many years has the professional been in business?</strong></p>
<p>You want to make sure that the professional you select has the skills, knowledge and experience to get you the results that you want.</p>
<p><strong>2. What is the professional’s ‘Track Record’?</strong></p>
<p>You only want to hire a Tax Resolution Professional with a successful track record.  Ask for specific information about the professional’s success rate.</p>
<p><strong>3. What are the professional’s qualifications?</strong></p>
<p>You should look for tax resolution companies that employ people who are licensed or certified as tax attorneys or tax resolution specialists.  CPAs often do not handle IRS tax problems.</p>
<p><strong>4. Does the professional have <u>actual experience</u> handling your type of case?</strong></p>
<p>While many attorneys and accountants have tax preparation experience, they do not possess the education, training and skills to negotiate with the IRS on a daily basis. Make sure that the professional you hire has actual, hands-on experience in solving your specific type of problem.</p>
<p><strong>5. How will the professional keep your information about your case?</strong></p>
<p>You want to be comfortable with the frequency of communications you will receive from the professional handling your case.  We generally communicate with our clients every 28 days and provide case status updates. You also want to make sure that you will receive all copies of all communication between the professional and the IRS.</p>
<p><strong>6. Is the pricing clear and easy to understand?</strong></p>
<p>An experienced and highly recommended tax resolution firm will be clear and forthright with its pricing and fee structure and tell you upfront exactly how much you can expect to pay to achieve resolution.</p>
<p><strong>7. What do clients say about his/her services?</strong></p>
<p>Please read <a href="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/testimonials-for-sfs-tax-problem-solutions/">what our clients are saying about us</a> as well as some of our <a href="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/settlements/">recent settlements</a>.</p>

			<h4><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> Valentine&#8217;s Day </strong></span></h4>
<p>Chocolates, flowers, cupid, and hearts are all associated with Valentine&#8217;s Day. According to the National Retail Federation, Americans now spend more than $20 billion lavishing gifts on their kids, friends, and significant others.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Who decided a day in the middle of February is a time to celebrate love and spend a bunch of money on gifts? The actual story of how Valentine&#8217;s Day (and its symbols) got its wings, and how much Americans spend on gifts for Valentine&#8217;s Day, might surprise you.</span></p>
<h4><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It&#8217;s named after a Catholic saint (perhaps).</span></strong></h4>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> There are stories of three different Catholic saints named Valentine, who was involved in various romantic shenanigans. The tales include conducting outlawed marriages, a secret relationship with a jailer&#8217;s daughter, and a love letter ending in &#8220;from your Valentine.&#8221; Unfortunately, all three saints met a similar fate by being put to death by Caesar. How romantic! While it&#8217;s pretty clear Valentine&#8217;s Day derives from one of these three saints, no one knows which one for sure. </span></p>
<h4><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It may have started as a <a href="https://www.learnreligions.com/valentines-day-pagan-celebrations-2562121">Pagan celebration</a>.</span></strong></h4>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Ancient Pagan festivals were often very unusual, and this one is no exception. Historians believe it involved goat and dog sacrifices, using their blood-stained animal hides, and having a drawing for a companion for the next year. It&#8217;s safe to say that everyone, especially your dog, is relieved this tradition fizzled out at some point. </span></p>
<h4><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Its primary color, red, has scientific backing.</span></strong></h4>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Giving flowers, especially red roses, is a popular romantic gesture all the way back to the Saint Valentine era. Why red? It represents passion and desire. According to a study by the University of Rochester, science ties color to behavior. The study demonstrates that men find women wearing red attire more attractive. </span></p>
<h4><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Americans spend an average of $162 on gifts.</span></strong></h4>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While the percentage of Americans who celebrate Valentine&#8217;s Day has declined over the past decade (63% of Americans celebrated the holiday in 2009 compared to 51% in 2019), those who do celebrate Valentine&#8217;s Day spent an average of $162 on gifts in 2019 compared to $103 in 2009.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Knowing the history of this holiday and how much money the average consumer spends on gifts for this special day adds context to the holiday. However, recreating the actual events is probably not a great idea. Instead, give your loved ones a hug, and a treat.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Have a wonderful Day!</span></p>

			<p>Of all the creditors or companies, you might owe money to, the Internal Revenue Service can be the least forgiving about debt. If you don&#8217;t pay your taxes, the IRS will levy and take possession of your property, including cash accounts, wages, and real and personal property. The IRS will sell non-liquid assets to raise funds to satisfy the debt you owe.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If you&#8217;ve received a levy notice from the IRS, it&#8217;s time to ACT IMMEDIATELY. Our firm may be able to get your levy released the same day, but you must call now for a confidential consultation. 877-355-8010 or   <a href="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/contact-us-at-sfs-tax-problem-solutions-in-stuart/">https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/contact-us-at-sfs-tax-problem-solutions-in-stuart/</a></span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Unless you don&#8217;t open your mail or you moved without leaving a forwarding address, you probably won&#8217;t be blindsided by an IRS levy. You&#8217;ll receive a &#8220;Notice and Demand for Payment&#8221; of your tax debt well in advance of any action taken. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If you ignore this notice, the IRS will follow up by sending you a &#8220;Final Notice of Intent to Levy and Notice of Your Rights to a Hearing.&#8221; Now the clock begins ticking. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">You have 30 days to pay your tax debt or to contact the IRS to try to stop the levy. Even if you&#8217;re unaware of the levy proceedings, your employer has a little bit of time to warn you if he receives notice that the IRS plans to take the bulk (which can be up to 90%) of your paychecks. Your employer doesn&#8217;t have to begin sending your earnings to the IRS until the next pay period. With any luck, your employer will let you know what&#8217;s going on within this time frame so that you can take action. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If the IRS levies your bank account, the bank will freeze the money in the account and remit it to the IRS after 21 days. Therefore, you must act quickly to try to have the funds released upon receiving a notice that the IRS has levied your bank account. </span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Contact A Tax Relief Firm</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Now is not the time to do it alone. If you call the IRS, they will often trick you into giving incriminating answers, further distancing you for the tax relief you so desperately need. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The IRS is NOT your friend. They are there to collect what they believe you owe in taxes. Contact a professional experienced in tax resolution to help you with your case. Would you go to court without a lawyer? Well, it&#8217;s the same with the IRS. You need professional representation from an Enrolled Agent, CPA, or tax attorney who is also a tax resolution specialist.</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Establish Hardship </span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If the IRS intends to levy your paycheck or Social Security benefits and you can&#8217;t come close to making ends meet on what&#8217;s left, the IRS wants you to contact them. The contact phone number should appear on the levy notice. DO NOT CALL THE IRS.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The law requires that the IRS leave you with the total of your tax exemptions for the year plus your standard deduction divided by 52 if you&#8217;re paid weekly. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Gather your documents and call us. We&#8217;ll help make the case to the IRS and explain that the levy will cause hardship for you and your family. You&#8217;ll have to provide documented evidence of this, but if you do, the IRS will release the levy. This doesn&#8217;t mean you no longer owe the tax. It just means that the IRS will leave your earnings and income alone and work with you to figure out some other way for you to satisfy the debt. </span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Make Payment Arrangements </span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">We can also ask for payment terms for your tax debt even if the levy won&#8217;t cripple you financially. If you enter into an installment agreement, the IRS will typically release the levy unless the notice you received specifically states otherwise. </span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">You Can &#8220;Settle&#8221; For Less Than You Owe</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">An offer in compromise allows you to settle your tax debt for less than the full amount you owe. It may be a legitimate option if you can&#8217;t pay your full tax liability or doing so creates a financial hardship. The IRS considers your unique set of facts and circumstances:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Ability to pay;</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Income;</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Expenses; and</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Asset equity.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The IRS will generally approve an offer in compromise when the amount offered represents the most they can expect to collect within a reasonable period of time. It&#8217;s best to explore all other payment options before submitting an offer in compromise as the Offer in Compromise program is not for everyone. Make sure you hire a tax professional to help you file an offer and be sure to check his or her qualifications.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The IRS doesn&#8217;t want to destroy you financially. They just want the money they are owed. If you can make an arrangement to pay or prove that you don&#8217;t owe the tax, or if you legitimately cannot pay it at this time, you may be able to make the levy go away. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Our firm specializes in tax resolution, even if you have years of unfiled tax returns, we can help! If you want a Certified Tax Resolution Specialist who knows how to navigate the IRS maze, reach out to our firm and we&#8217;ll schedule a no-obligation confidential consultation to explain your options to permanently resolve your tax problem. <a href="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/contact-us-at-sfs-tax-problem-solutions-in-stuart/">https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/contact-us-at-sfs-tax-problem-solutions-in-stuart/ </a></span></p>

<p>Vincent Celentano, the owner of several businesses in Florida and Michigan, was indicted for tax evasion, employment tax fraud, and other tax-related crimes.</p>
<p>Celentano was recently accused of using more than $360,000 from his businesses’ bank accounts to pay for personal expenses, including credit card payments and fuel and sundry items for his yacht. During the same year, Celentano sold ownership in entities under his control for approximately 2.7 million dollars. He also asked for payment in a way that kept his accountants from accurately reporting the sale to the IRS. Also, Celentano failed to file his individual tax returns from 2013 to 2016.</p>
<p>From 2013 to 2018, Celentano and others conspired to withhold payroll taxes from his employees and not pay the taxes to the IRS. He used the money to pay for business and personal expenses. When the IRS tried to collect, Celentano and his co-conspirators attempted to thwart their efforts and made false statements to the IRS about who was responsible for paying the taxes. According to the indictment, Celentano failed to pay over $216,700 in payroll taxes.</p>
<p>If convicted, Celentano faces a statutory maximum sentence of five years for each tax evasion and conspiracy charges. He will also receive three years in prison for each count of failure to pay employment taxes. And a statutory maximum sentence of one year on each count of willful failure to file his personal tax returns.</p>

<p>A gambling addiction led Los Angeles CPA Jonathan Schwartz, the business manager for Alanis Morissette and other well-known performers and athletes, to steal more than seven million dollars from his clients’ accounts.</p>
<p>Schwartz had access to his clients’ bank accounts to pay their bills and get cash for them, but instead, he frequently took money for himself. He concealed the embezzlement by not sending bank statements to his clients. Instead, he sent his clients a prepared statement from GSO Business Management, the firm Schwartz worked for, which contained a false ledger of expenses submitted to the bookkeepers by Schwartz.</p>
<p>Schwartz admitted that between 2010 and 2014, he stole almost five million dollars from Morissette by falsifying records and claiming the expenses were for “sundry/personal” items. He took more than a million dollars from another client and embezzled $737,500 from yet another client.</p>
<p>Schwartz admitted that he failed to file a tax return in 2012 and failed to report nearly one million dollars in income that year. He owes the IRS almost 1.7 million dollars in federal income taxes. Schwartz was sentenced to six years in prison, followed by three years of supervised release. He was ordered to pay $8,657,268 in restitution.</p>

			<h4 style="text-align: center;"><em><strong><span style="color: #008000;"> She Got Caught Trying to Rip Off the System </span></strong></em></h4>
<p>Movita Johnson-Harrell, a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, has resigned from office after being accused of using funds for personal items from a non-profit. She created the tax exempt entity to help people struggling with addiction, poverty, and mental illness. She founded the non-profit, Motivations, Education &amp; Consultation Associates (MECA), after losing four family members, her father, brother, cousin, and son, to gun violence.</p>
<p>She is alleged to have spent more than $500,000 from the charity’s bank accounts to pay personal items, such as vacations, private school tuition for her grandchildren. Also, she bought designer clothes, matching furs for her and her husband and a Porsche. She also funneled money from the account into her state representative campaign. The disgraced politician took money from her clients’ government benefits, which the non-profit controlled to provide housing, and then covered it up by lying on her financial records, and those of the non-profit and her campaign.</p>
<p>Attorney General Josh Shapiro claims that Johnson-Harrell committed tax fraud when she failed to report her MECA spending as income. In addition to making direct transfers to her bank account, Johnson-Harrell wrote numerous checks made out to ‘cash’ whenever she needed extra money. Johnson-Harrell is awaiting trial.</p>
<p>The money from the non-existent books was illegally funneled to her political campaign through a straw company, and used for personal items, including a house. For the tax year 2016, Pugh claimed her taxable income was $31,020, and the tax due was $4,168. In reality, her taxable income was $322,365, and she approximately owed $102,444.</p>
<p>The federal government is hoping to seize a house owned by Pugh worth $770,000. Meanwhile, Pugh’s attorney claims that she is so fragile physically and mentally; she is unable to make “major decisions.” If convicted, she could serve up to 100 years in prison.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><em><span style="color: #008000;">The ABCs of Tax Resolution Explained</span></em></strong></h4>
<p>One of the most common questions I hear is, “I owe the IRS years of back taxes, what are my options?” The good news is the IRS has many other options available to alleviate an individual’s back taxes.</p>
<p>When you have a tax problem, your best bet is to work with a Certified Tax Resolution Specialist (CTRS),and Enrolled Agent (EA). During the process, there are many terms that you are likely to hear that are unfamiliar to you and notices that you will probably receive from the IRS or state.</p>
<p>We have begun a series of blogs, “The ABCs of Tax Resolution” that will provide you with a brief overview of many of these terms and concepts.</p>
<p>Our latest blog, <a href="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/g-is-for-garnishment/">G is for Garnishment</a> is posted.</p>
<p>Read A-F here <a href="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/abcs-of-tax-resolution/">The Tax Resolution ABCs</a></p>

<p>A Port Murray, New Jersey tax preparer Brian Day, pleaded guilty to filing false tax returns and bank fraud in a scheme to misappropriate clients’ money and defraud the IRS.</p>
<p>Day told his clients that they owed more money to the IRS than they did. He instructed them to write checks made out to the IRS and then altered the payee information on the checks to make them payable to one of his tax preparation companies. He made these false claims to at least five individuals, resulting in a loss of $124,289 for his clients.</p>
<p>When two clients questioned him about the checks, he presented them with fake documents he claimed were from the IRS.</p>
<p>Additionally, Day is accused of submitting at least 21 false tax returns to the IRS from tax years 2009 to 2015, resulting in a loss of approximately $491,000 to the IRS.</p>
<p>From 2013 to 2015, he also inflated clients’ tax forms by more than $383,000 to get them larger tax returns.</p>
<p>Day was sentenced to 32 months in prison and ordered to pay nearly $500,000 in restitution.</p>

			<h4><strong><span style="color: #008000;"><em>What Do I Do? I Didn’t Report My Crypto Trades On Prior Year&#8217;s Tax Return?</em></span></strong></h4>
<p>In 2014 the IRS determined that cryptocurrency was property for tax purposes, and there are well-established rules for how to treat property. However, many people aren&#8217;t disclosing their cryptocurrency transactions. If you were buying and selling cryptocurrency at any point in the past few years, you need to report these transactions on your annual tax return.</p>
<p>The IRS has ramped up its efforts to go after those that did not correctly report their cryptocurrency-trading on prior years&#8217; tax returns.<br />
Back in the summer of 2019, the IRS mailed some 10,000 letters to crypto account owners to educate crypto account holders about the rules. And tell taxpayers to review their tax reporting for crypto transactions to be sure they reported income correctly.</p>

			<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Question: </strong></span></p>
<p>I own a small business, and to keep the doors open, I did not pay the IRS for my employee’s withholding taxes for a few years. How much trouble will I be in?</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer: </strong></span></p>
<p>Owing 941 payroll taxes is very different than owing personal 1040 income taxes. Not only can the IRS shut down your business, but they can also come after you personally, and levy your bank accounts. They can also take your receivables and seize your property, including your house. Even more frightening is the fact that what might seem to you as a small tax problem could turn into a criminal matter. Why? Because the money was already deducted from your employee’s payroll checks, so it’s not your money, to begin with! The IRS looks at this as if you stole their money.</p>

<p>The image might look familiar as I previously made it with tortellini. This recipe calls for gnocchi. I used the packaged variety found on the shelf in the pasta isle.</p>
<p>It is a super easy weeknight recipe that can be prepped ahead of time. Needless to say, I added tons more garlic, lots of fresh basil, rosemary and thyme from my garden and plenty of black pepper. It was so good!</p>
<p>Jeff who is a true carnivore really enjoyed this dish, even without meat or shellfish. Perhaps I will add some jumbo shrimp next time.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: left;">What Do I Do? I Didn’t Report My Crypto Trades On Prior Year&#8217;s Tax Return?</h5>
<p>In 2014 the IRS determined that cryptocurrency was property for tax purposes. There are well-established rules for how to treat property in place. However, many people aren&#8217;t disclosing their cryptocurrency transactions. If you were buying and selling cryptocurrency at any point in the past few years, you needed to report these transactions on your annual tax return.</p>
<p>The IRS has ramped up its efforts to go after those that did not correctly report their cryptocurrency-trading on prior years&#8217; tax returns.</p>
<p>Back in the summer of 2019, the IRS mailed some 10,000 letters to crypto account owners to educate crypto account holders about the rules.  And tell taxpayers to review their tax reporting for crypto transactions to be sure they reported income correctly.</p>
<p>Forbes published an article on July 31, 2019, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2019/07/31/watch-out-cryptocurrency-owners-the-irs-is-on-the-hunt/#3d2e522d6990">Watch Out Cryptocurrency Owners, The IRS Is On The Hunt.</a> The article explained the letters traders received from the IRS. It stated that &#8220;The IRS might know there is unreported income based on tax information obtained through enforcement actions, which include the summons against U.S. Coinbase customers. You received the letter because you didn&#8217;t file a tax return, which should have included virtual currency transactions. Alternatively, you filed a return but did not report virtual currency transactions. You must reply to this tax notice by submitting a correct late tax return or an amended return.&#8221; They further went on to state that &#8220;Letter 6173 is a severe tax notice, and you should not dig yourself into a bigger hole with an incorrect reply. In some cases, perjury could be a felony. The letter states, &#8220;If we don&#8217;t hear from you by the &#8220;respond by&#8221; date, we may refer your tax account for examination.&#8221;</p>
<p>The IRS advised, “Taxpayers who do not properly report the income tax consequences of virtual currency transactions are, when appropriate, liable for tax, penalties, and interest. In some cases, taxpayers could be subject to criminal prosecution.”</p>
<p>On October 6, the IRS released a ruling with guidance for cryptocurrency holders. They also sent out correspondences advising virtual currency owners to pay their back taxes. If you received a letter from the IRS, you should consult with me immediately.</p>
<p>I am an Advanced Crypto Tax Expert (ACT-E) and specially trained to help taxpayers resolve any outstanding issue to your incorrectly filed tax returns.  <img class="alignright wp-image-2533" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ACT-E-designation-1-300x257.png" alt="Advanced Crypto Expert designation" width="256" height="219" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ACT-E-designation-1-300x257.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ACT-E-designation-1.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px" /></p>
<h5 style="text-align: left;">I didn’t report my crypto trades on my prior year&#8217;s tax return? What do I do?</h5>
<p style="text-align: left;">Did you know that the IRS can go back up to three years to prosecute cases of tax evasion, and in cases where they find significant errors, they can go back up to six years or more? Many crypto investors and traders are concerned about getting audited and having a future tax liability that they can’t afford. The solution to this potential problem is to be proactive and amend your previous years’ return.</p>
<p>What should you do if you already filed your tax return and didn’t report your cryptocurrency gains on that return? Amend your tax return for whichever year(s) you didn’t report your crypto trades. You have three years from the date that you filed your return to file an amended return. The IRS is more forgiving to those who make a good-faith effort to pay their taxes.</p>
<p>To accurately calculate how much money you owe in capital gains, you have to know what the Fair Market Value of the cryptocurrency was at the time of the trade. For traders who have executed hundreds, if not thousands of trades over the years, this can be a daunting task.</p>
<p>As an ACT-E, I have the specific expertise to help taxpayers who didn’t report all of their crypto gains get back on track. We can amend both federal and state income tax returns to report missing crypto gains or other income.</p>
<p>However,  the past three years of tax returns should be amended, but depending on the exact circumstances, a more extended period might be necessary. I can help you assess your current situation and determine how many years you need to amend.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>G is for garnishment. Wage garnishment is one of the most common types of garnishment. The IRS can garnish or legally seize any income you make to satisfy federal tax debt or taxes owed.</p>
<h5>Garnishments can apply to your hourly wages, salary, commissions, and bonuses.</h5>
<p>When the IRS seeks to garnish your wages for a tax debt that you owe, it will first send you a written notice that sets out the amounts that you owe. The notice will include the tax, penalties, and interest. This notice should also provide you with a due date by which you must pay the balances in full. Assuming that you do not pay the balance in full, you later will receive another notice, entitled “Final Notice of Intent to Levy.” Once thirty days have passed from the time you have received the final notice, and you still have failed to pay the balance due, the IRS can proceed with garnishing your income.</p>
<p>The law places limits on the amount that a creditor can garnish from your wages. These normal limits do not apply to the IRS. The tax code requires the IRS to leave you with a certain amount of income after garnishing your wages to pay your tax debt. The tax code contains a table that corresponds to the number of exemptions that you claim for tax purposes. It tells the amount necessary for you and your family to pay for basic living necessities. Unfortunately, a garnishment by the IRS can amount to 70% or more of your income.</p>
<p>There are several different ways in which you can resolve your problem with the IRS. To stop a wage garnishment, you must get back into good standing with the IRS, either by paying your balance in full or entering into a tax payment plan or some other type of resolution.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Three Tax Resolution Strategies Offered by the IRS</strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Taxes are a fact of life, but tax problems aren’t. If you find yourself in tax trouble, the IRS has definitive guidelines for how to proceed in collecting what they believe you owe them. After sending you notices, the IRS can garnish your wages, levy your bank account, even put a lien on your property. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, the IRS also has tax relief options for taxpayers. In this blog, we will provide the three strategies offered by the IRS to resolve your tax debt.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Note, we always recommend getting in touch with a tax resolution specialist to help avoid the harsh penalties and interest that accrued on your back taxes. It’s far easier to navigate towards tax resolution if you have a professional working with you. If you’d like to schedule a no-cost confidential tax relief consultation, contact us at <a href="http://bit.ly/2Hh7cEl"><em>http://bit.ly/2Hh7cEl</em></a></span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Let’s review the three tax relief options:</span></p>
<h5><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">1. Penalty Abatement (PA) &#8211; If I Can’t Afford to Pay My Taxes, Why do They Keep Adding Penalties?</span></strong></h5>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The IRS doesn’t like being ignored, so adding penalties is a way for them to grab and keep your attention. They want to be sure you know they are not going away. If you don’t respond to the initial notice, they add penalties (and interest). Penalties are just the beginning of what they can do to your life. You should also be aware that there are several penalties which the IRS can assess at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The IRS may provide administrative relief from a penalty that would otherwise be applicable under its First Time Penalty Abatement policy. To see if you qualify, call our firm at 877.355.8010 at <a href="http://bit.ly/2Hh7cEl">http://bit.ly/2Hh7cEl</a></span></p>
<h5><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">2. Offer in Compromise (OIC) &#8211; Pay Less Than You Owe </span></strong></h5>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">You’ve probably seen the tax relief firms advertising this on Radio and TV as a way to settle your tax debt for less than the full amount. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Not everyone qualifies, however. It’s essential to get expert help, so your offer has a higher chance of being accepted. Before you submit an offer, you must make sure that you’re in compliance by filing delinquent tax returns. Then correctly structuring your offer in a way that the IRS will accept it. Having someone who’s negotiated these offers like our firm is indispensable. Think of it this way; would you go to court without a lawyer? Of course not. Well, it’s the same thing here. You need an experienced IRS tax problem solver to represent you before the IRS.</span></p>
<h5><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">3. Get on A Properly Structured Payment Plan</span></strong></h5>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Your specific tax situation will determine which payment options are available to you. Payment options include full payment, a short-term payment plan (paying in 120 days or less), or a long-term payment plan (installment agreement) (paying in more than 120 days).</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It’s important to structure your payment plan properly. SFS. Tax Problem Solutions can help you set up an Installment Agreement (IA) or Partial Payment Installment Agreement (PPIA) depending on your situation</span></p>
<h5><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Here’s How We Help You Get Your Life Back</span></strong></h5>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Some people don’t know what returns have to be filed or what they owe: their personal or business bookkeeping and recordkeeping is a mess or non-existent. After we register our Power of Attorney with the IRS and get you protected, the second step we take is to get all your IRS tax records from the IRS to see where you stand. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">After that, with your help, we prepare all your delinquent income tax returns and get them filed with IRS. And lastly, we negotiate the best possible resolution that permanently solves your IRS difficulties. That may mean negotiating an Offer in Compromise, a writing a properly structured Payment Plan, determining a Currently Not Collectible Status, effecting a Penalty Reduction, and more.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Most of this takes place without you ever coming to our offices. We live in a day and age where technology makes it easy for us to represent you no matter where you reside.
