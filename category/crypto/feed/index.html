			<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">After years of flying under the radar, taxpayers who hold Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and other cryptocurrencies are finally getting scrutinized by the IRS its time to come clean about taxes on cryptocurrency. The IRS has determined that cryptocurrency is here to stay and that the outrageous refunds that early adopters have enjoyed could be a massive windfall for government coffers.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">The tax agency has also figured out that many earliest adopters to late comers who are holders of crypto could owe a lot of money on these assets. The currency may be virtual, but to the IRS, the taxes that are due are all too real.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">Note &#8211; if you think you might owe back taxes on your crypto, we encourage all readers to contact us at </span><a href="http://bit.ly/2Hh7cEl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><span style="color: #0e101a;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://bit.ly/2Hh7cE</span>l</span></em></a><span style="color: #0e101a;">.

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">The Illusion of Anonymity</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">If you have been skating along under the veil of anonymity and failing to report your cryptocurrency holdings, you might want to rethink your strategy. After years of taking a mostly hands-off approach, the IRS is catching up in a big way. The agency is pulling out all the stops to recover the money the government believes is owed to them.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">Many holders of cryptocurrency are under the mistaken impression that their transactions are totally anonymous, and that there is no way for the IRS, or anyone else, to tell how much they hold or how they use their virtual coins. That may be a soothing fiction, but the reality is far different.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">The truth is that the IRS has a wide range of options at its disposal. From official form filings to subpoenas and legal documents, to pierce the veil of anonymity and find the real-world identities of cryptocurrency holders.</span></p>
<h5><strong><img class="alignright wp-image-4821" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IRS-form-1099-K-2020-300x158.png" alt="come clean about taxes on cryptocurrency- form 1099K" width="532" height="280" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IRS-form-1099-K-2020-300x158.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IRS-form-1099-K-2020-768x404.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IRS-form-1099-K-2020.png 1000w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IRS-form-1099-K-2020-700x368.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 532px) 100vw, 532px" />Did You Get a 1099-K? Well, So Did the IRS</strong></h5>
<p>In some cases, holders of cryptocurrency are finding tax forms in their mailboxes. If you receive this form, you can be sure the IRS received a copy as well.</p>
<p>When you file your taxes, an automatic matching program will compare the amount you claimed with the amount on these automatically generated forms. If there is a mismatch, you will hear from the IRS.</p>
<p>One of the most common forms used to report cryptocurrency holdings and transactions is the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/understanding-your-form-1099-k">1099-K</a>. For sellers on eBay and some freelancers, this form will already be familiar. Still, it is being extended into the virtual world as well. If you receive a 1099-K form this year, it is time to come clean with your cryptocurrency holdings.</p>
<h5><strong>The Cryptocurrency Question and Your Tax Form</strong></h5>
<p>Until now, cryptocurrency holders could and often did, plead ignorance. They could claim they did not realize their Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other virtual holdings were taxable. They could back up that assertion by saying the IRS never asked them about these assets. Time to come clean about taxes on cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>The validity of that excuse may have been questionable. Now that thin veil of supposed ignorance will be gone. Beginning with the 2019 tax return, taxpayers will be asked directly on their 1040 if they bought, sold, transacted, or otherwise acquired any cryptocurrency. They will be expected to answer that question truthfully.</p>
<p>The wording of this question means anyone who holds any cryptocurrency would be required to answer in the affirmative. Even so, merely holding virtual coins in a cryptocurrency wallet does not necessarily imply any taxes will be due. Someone who holds cryptocurrency but makes no transactions should not owe any taxes just as a holder of stock does not owe taxes until they sell the shares.</p>
<p>Come clean about taxes on cryptocurrency as the IRS is getting serious about cryptocurrency, drawn by a combination of past returns, unreported taxes, and increased exposure of these alternative forms of payment.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: left;">What Do I Do? I Didn’t Report My Crypto Trades On Prior Year&#8217;s Tax Return?</h5>
<p>In 2014 the IRS determined that cryptocurrency was property for tax purposes. There are well-established rules for how to treat property in place. However, many people aren&#8217;t disclosing their cryptocurrency transactions. If you were buying and selling cryptocurrency at any point in the past few years, you needed to report these transactions on your annual tax return.</p>
<p>The IRS has ramped up its efforts to go after those that did not correctly report their cryptocurrency-trading on prior years&#8217; tax returns.</p>
<p>Back in the summer of 2019, the IRS mailed some 10,000 letters to crypto account owners to educate crypto account holders about the rules.  And tell taxpayers to review their tax reporting for crypto transactions to be sure they reported income correctly.</p>
<p>Forbes published an article on July 31, 2019, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2019/07/31/watch-out-cryptocurrency-owners-the-irs-is-on-the-hunt/#3d2e522d6990">Watch Out Cryptocurrency Owners, The IRS Is On The Hunt.</a> The article explained the letters traders received from the IRS. It stated that &#8220;The IRS might know there is unreported income based on tax information obtained through enforcement actions, which include the summons against U.S. Coinbase customers. You received the letter because you didn&#8217;t file a tax return, which should have included virtual currency transactions. Alternatively, you filed a return but did not report virtual currency transactions. You must reply to this tax notice by submitting a correct late tax return or an amended return.&#8221; They further went on to state that &#8220;Letter 6173 is a severe tax notice, and you should not dig yourself into a bigger hole with an incorrect reply. In some cases, perjury could be a felony. The letter states, &#8220;If we don&#8217;t hear from you by the &#8220;respond by&#8221; date, we may refer your tax account for examination.&#8221;</p>
<p>The IRS advised, “Taxpayers who do not properly report the income tax consequences of virtual currency transactions are, when appropriate, liable for tax, penalties, and interest. In some cases, taxpayers could be subject to criminal prosecution.”</p>
<p>On October 6, the IRS released a ruling with guidance for cryptocurrency holders. They also sent out correspondences advising virtual currency owners to pay their back taxes. If you received a letter from the IRS, you should consult with me immediately.</p>
<p>I am an Advanced Crypto Tax Expert (ACT-E) and specially trained to help taxpayers resolve any outstanding issue to your incorrectly filed tax returns.  <img class="alignright wp-image-2533" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ACT-E-designation-1-300x257.png" alt="Advanced Crypto Expert designation" width="256" height="219" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ACT-E-designation-1-300x257.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ACT-E-designation-1.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px" /></p>
<h5 style="text-align: left;">I didn’t report my crypto trades on my prior year&#8217;s tax return? What do I do?</h5>
<p style="text-align: left;">Did you know that the IRS can go back up to three years to prosecute cases of tax evasion, and in cases where they find significant errors, they can go back up to six years or more? Many crypto investors and traders are concerned about getting audited and having a future tax liability that they can’t afford. The solution to this potential problem is to be proactive and amend your previous years’ return.</p>
<p>What should you do if you already filed your tax return and didn’t report your cryptocurrency gains on that return? Amend your tax return for whichever year(s) you didn’t report your crypto trades. You have three years from the date that you filed your return to file an amended return. The IRS is more forgiving to those who make a good-faith effort to pay their taxes.</p>
<p>To accurately calculate how much money you owe in capital gains, you have to know what the Fair Market Value of the cryptocurrency was at the time of the trade. For traders who have executed hundreds, if not thousands of trades over the years, this can be a daunting task.</p>
<p>As an ACT-E, I have the specific expertise to help taxpayers who didn’t report all of their crypto gains get back on track. We can amend both federal and state income tax returns to report missing crypto gains or other income.</p>
<p>However,  the past three years of tax returns should be amended, but depending on the exact circumstances, a more extended period might be necessary. I can help you assess your current situation and determine how many years you need to amend.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This article about Cryptocurrency Tax Loss Harvesting explains:</p>
<ul>
<li>what is tax loss harvesting</li>
<li>how you can use this method to reduce your cryptocurrency tax liability</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the most effective ways to reduce your tax bill for the year is to engage in tax loss harvesting with your cryptocurrency assets. It’s common knowledge that cryptocurrencies are incredibly volatile. Realizing your tax loss and other characteristics make it a useful candidate for tax loss harvesting strategies.</p>
<h4>What is Tax Loss Harvesting?</h4>
<p>Tax Loss Harvesting is the practice of selling a capital asset at a loss to offset a capital gains tax liability. By realizing or “harvesting” a loss, investors can offset taxes on both gains and income. This is a tax reduction strategy often used in the world of stocks and securities.</p>
<h5>Let’s look at a general example:</h5>
<p>Beth buys $1,000 of Microsoft stock and $2,000 of Apple stock in a given year. While holding these investments, the value of her Microsoft stock rises to $1,500, while Apple drops to $1,700. She sells all of his Microsoft stock for $1,500.</p>
<h5>Without Tax Loss Harvesting</h5>
<p>Without harvesting her losses in Microsoft stock, Beth has a $500 capital gain for the year from the sale of her Microsoft stock. She pays taxes on all $500 of this capital gain.</p>
<h5>With Tax Loss Harvesting</h5>
<p>Rather than continuing to hold her Apple stock, Beth can harvest her losses in Apple by selling before the year-end. Capital gains and losses get added together for the year resulting in either a net gain or loss. Her net capital gain is now only $200 for the year ($500 &#8211; $300). In this scenario, Beth only pays taxes on $200 of net capital gains rather than $500.</p>
<h4>All About Cryptocurrency Tax Loss Harvesting</h4>
<h3><img class="alignright wp-image-4416" style="font-size: 1.125rem; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: 'Akkurat Std', -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/stocks-crypto-currency-Bitcoin-ZCash-Litecoin-300x158.png" alt="stocks- zcash-litecoin-sfs tax problem solutions" width="361" height="190" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/stocks-crypto-currency-Bitcoin-ZCash-Litecoin-300x158.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/stocks-crypto-currency-Bitcoin-ZCash-Litecoin-768x404.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/stocks-crypto-currency-Bitcoin-ZCash-Litecoin.png 1000w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/stocks-crypto-currency-Bitcoin-ZCash-Litecoin-700x368.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 361px) 100vw, 361px" /></h3>
<p>Cryptocurrencies are always treated as property for tax purposes, the same as traditional stocks. This means that you can strategically sell or trade crypto to harvest losses and reduce your tax liability. However, unlike stocks, cryptocurrencies have unique characteristics that make them even better candidates for tax loss harvesting.</p>
<h5>Wash Sale Rules</h5>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; white-space: normal; background-color: #ffffff;"> </span>A wash sale results when you sustain a capital loss and then repurchase the same security within 30-days. This is before or after the capital loss is incurred. It was designed to prevent investors from taking capital losses in one year and then immediately buying back the stock. The <a href="https://www.irs.gov/publications/p550#en_US_2016_publink100010601">IRS</a> states that the wash sale rules apply only to securities. It was deemed that Cryptocurrencies are property, and not securities, as defined by the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-21.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IRS guidance</a>. This means that currently, the wash sales rules do not apply to cryptocurrency.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Volatility</h5>
<ul>
<li>Cryptocurrencies are very volatile, more so than traditional assets. This volatility means that investors have extensive opportunities to realize and harvest capital losses. The problematic part for investors is identifying which of the cryptocurrencies (in their portfolios) have the highest cost basis (original purchase price) when they are compared to the current market price. These are the assets that present the most significant opportunity for tax savings.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Let’s look at another example:</h4>
<p>Alan has made $15,000 in capital gains from investing in the stock market this year. He has also been investing in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, XRP, and Ethereum. In December, he notices that his investments are down over $20,000 for the year. To harvest these losses, Alan trades all of his cryptocurrencies into Litecoin.  Thus incurring a <em>taxable event</em> and realizing his losses. Alan’s losses in cryptocurrency completely offset all of his stock market gains, and he then will have a capital loss for the year of $5000.</p>
<h4>Net Capital Losses Up to $3,000 Offset Ordinary Income</h4>
<ul>
<li>When total capital gains and losses for the year add up to a loss, a net capital loss is then incurred.</li>
<li>If the net capital loss is less than or equal to $3,000 ($1,500 if you are married and filing a separate tax return), then that entire capital loss can be used to offset other types of income &#8211; such as the job-related income.</li>
<li>Net losses exceeding $3,000 are rolled forward to subsequent years.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Sell or Trade Once Detected</h4>
<ul>
<li>Once you determine which cryptocurrencies present the best tax savings opportunities, you can then sell or trade them on your exchange of choice. You must understand that selling or trading your crypto will trigger a <em>taxable event</em> and “realize” your losses in the asset. December 31st is the deadline.</li>
</ul>
<p>The tax year ends on Dec. 31<sup>st</sup>, even though the filing deadline isn’t until April 15th. This means that you must realize your losses before the end of the year if you want them to impact that year’s taxes.</p>
<p>Many investors delay only to discover that they could have saved money on their tax bill if they would have sold or taken their losses in December. And by then it’s too late.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Early Adopters of Cryptocurrency Should Explore Their Tax Resolution Options. The stunning rise in the value of Bitcoin, along with the myriad of cryptocurrencies, is surely one of the biggest financial stories of the 21st century, at least so far. What started out as a mere curiosity and niche project for programmers and geeks has quickly blossomed into a full-fledged financial asset, and an increasingly popular one at that.</p>
<p>For early adopters, the financial returns have been simply mind-boggling. You may have heard about the generation of Bitcoin millionaires, and there are plenty of those newly rich investors to go around.</p>
<p>Given the rapid rise and relative anonymity of Bitcoin transactions, it was only a matter of time before the IRS caught on, and the tax agency has caught on &#8211; and caught up &#8211; in a big way. After years of taking a hands-off approach to cryptocurrency investments, the IRS is now paying close attention &#8211; and requesting the real-world identities of those supposedly anonymous buyers and sellers.</p>
<p>While every investor in cryptocurrency should be aware of their potential tax liability, the problem could be even more acute for early adopters &#8211; the very investors who have profited the most from this unique form of digital payment.</p>
<p>As with all things tax, the Internal Revenue Service is likely to start where the big money is, and the tax agency has increasingly set their sights on early adopters. If you were prescient enough to buy into the promise of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies when everyone else was looking the other way, it may be time to settle up with the IRS.</p>
<h4>Early Adopters of Cryptocurrencies</h4>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-3908" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2019-taxpayer-roadmap-300x296.jpg" alt="IRS road map maze" width="277" height="274" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2019-taxpayer-roadmap-300x296.jpg 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2019-taxpayer-roadmap.jpg 611w" sizes="(max-width: 277px) 100vw, 277px" /></p>
<p>For early adopters of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, a little proactivity could go a long way. The IRS has already requested records from Coinbase and other big cryptocurrency exchanges, and it is only a matter of time before they catch up to you and your profits.</p>
<p>For now, the tax agency claims it has requested information on only the largest accounts, but it is reasonable to assume the IRS will expand its scope in the future. If you have booked your Bitcoin profits and want to settle up with the IRS, contacting a tax resolution agency now could save you a lot of money &#8211; and potentially a lot of grief.</p>
<p>There are many reasons for early adopters of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to work with a tax resolution company, starting with the complexity of reporting profits in digital currency. The IRS is still fairly new to regulating and taxing cryptocurrency, and there has been a lot of confusion and misinformation over how profits are taxed and how people are supposed to pay.</p>
<p>Regardless, if you haven’t reported your crypto earnings or filed your taxes for the past few years, it’s time to do so now. By working with a tax resolution expert, you will gain access to a world of expertise, so you can draw on that knowledge to accurately report how much cryptocurrency you have purchased, how many coins you have used and how much you have gained or lost on each transaction.</p>
<p>This accounting is very important since it could impact not only your tax bill but any future taxes and penalties. According to the IRS, holders and users of cryptocurrencies have been responsible for reporting their gains all along and failing to do so could mean big penalties and lots of back interest.</p>
<h4>Tax Resolution Specialist</h4>
<p>A tax resolution specialist will be able to guide you through what is surely one of the most complicated tax situations in many years. The very complexity of the cryptocurrency market makes navigating the tax consequences especially difficult, and it never hurts to have some expert assistance in your corner. So, do yourself a favor and come clean now &#8211; <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-has-begun-sending-letters-to-virtual-currency-owners-advising-them-to-pay-back-taxes-file-amended-returns-part-of-agencys-larger-efforts">the IRS has finally caught on</a> to the cryptocurrency revolution, and the tax agency is making up for lost time and making the lives of early adopters a lot more difficult.</p>

<p>The term “cryptocurrency” is short for “cryptographic currency”. It refers to a new type of digital money. Crypto is a digital currency in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds, operating independently of a central bank.</p>
<p>Although most people tend to forget, Cryptocurrency losses count as capital losses. Deducting those capital losses at <a href="https://smartereum.com/45736/cryptocurrency-taxes-crypto-tax-questions-answered/">tax time</a> can help you move into a lower tax bracket. Moving down a bracket can result in thousands of dollars of tax savings.</p>
<p>Deducting a capital loss on your tax return is not as hard as you’d think. We’ll even tell you how it’s done.</p>
<h2><strong>Capital Losses and Capital Gains</strong></h2>
<p>The IRS categorizes each transaction you make when trading cryptocurrency in one of two ways. Each buy or sell order results in either a <strong>capital loss</strong> or a <strong>capital gain</strong>. You also have short term or long term depending if you held the currency for one year or more.</p>
<p>If you bought an entire Bitcoin at the beginning of the year when the price was hovering around $10,000 and sold today for $3,700, you would incur a $6,300 (short term) capital loss. You can then use this loss to move into a lower tax bracket.</p>
<h2><strong>Moving into a lower bracket can save you thousands</strong></h2>
<p>If you lost money trading cryptocurrency in 2018, your losses will count against the net income that you earned during the year.</p>
<p>The image below shows the tax brackets that the IRS uses to determine how much you owe. As you can see, the difference between the two brackets is quite large. The base rate for single individuals that made between $82,501 and $157,500 is nearly <em>four times</em> the base rate for single people that made between $9,526 and $38,700.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3014" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Cryptocurrency-Can-Save-You-Thousands-in-Taxes-bracket-single-bracket.png" alt="Cryptocurrency Can Save You Thousands in Taxes, bracket, single bracket" width="1370" height="372" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Cryptocurrency-Can-Save-You-Thousands-in-Taxes-bracket-single-bracket.png 1370w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Cryptocurrency-Can-Save-You-Thousands-in-Taxes-bracket-single-bracket-300x81.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Cryptocurrency-Can-Save-You-Thousands-in-Taxes-bracket-single-bracket-768x209.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Cryptocurrency-Can-Save-You-Thousands-in-Taxes-bracket-single-bracket-1024x278.png 1024w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Cryptocurrency-Can-Save-You-Thousands-in-Taxes-bracket-single-bracket-700x190.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1370px) 100vw, 1370px" />Married people filing jointly can save even more by dropping to a lower bracket.</h4>
<h2><strong><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3013" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Cryptocurrency-Can-Save-You-Thousands-in-Taxes-bracket-married-bracket.png" alt="Cryptocurrency Can Save You Thousands in Taxes, bracket, married bracket" width="1266" height="1072" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Cryptocurrency-Can-Save-You-Thousands-in-Taxes-bracket-married-bracket.png 1266w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Cryptocurrency-Can-Save-You-Thousands-in-Taxes-bracket-married-bracket-300x254.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Cryptocurrency-Can-Save-You-Thousands-in-Taxes-bracket-married-bracket-768x650.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Cryptocurrency-Can-Save-You-Thousands-in-Taxes-bracket-married-bracket-1024x867.png 1024w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Cryptocurrency-Can-Save-You-Thousands-in-Taxes-bracket-married-bracket-700x593.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1266px) 100vw, 1266px" /></strong><strong>You can deduct up to $3,000 from ordinary income</strong></h2>
<p>The IRS allows you to deduct up to $3,000 from ordinary income.</p>
<p>Losses can offset taxable gains—even on other investments such as stocks or land. Any excess losses – up to $3,000 &#8211; can also offset other types of income. This includes your wages, and unused losses carry forward either forever or until fully deducted.</p>
<p>That means that if your day job puts you slightly above the limit for your particular tax bracket, deducting your crypto losses can help you drop to a lower bracket.</p>
<h2><strong>Determining the amount of your loss</strong></h2>
<p>If the crypto exchange you use saves a record of your transactions, you may be able to add up these numbers yourself by downloading a CSV file.</p>
<p>If you’re a bit unsure of any of the answers, it’s time to see an Enrolled Agent. The IRS is receiving names and account data from the exchanges (like they did from the <a href="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/458-billion-owed-in-back-taxes/">foreign banks</a>) and will come after those not reporting their crypto transactions. If you do not report these items, especially the FINCEN, the penalties can be enormous. The FBAR (previously known as FinCEN) is where you have to report accounts in foreign banks that have $10,000 at any moment.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Crypto Tax: IRS Catching Investors Who Don&#8217;t Pay Taxes</h2>
<p>Those who invest in Cryptocurrency may not be aware that there is a tax on Crypto, just like everything else in the world. Cryptocurrency investors have mostly flown under the radar as far as taxes are concerned. Now those days are coming to an end, and many of those with digital wallets are scrambling to understand what they owe and how their investments may impact their finances.</p>
<p>The IRS is already on top of discovering the identities of those who hold substantial amounts of cryptocurrency, and it is only a matter of time until the tax agency broadens its scope. Just as with <a href="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/irs-forces-full-disclosure-for-overseas-accounts/">overseas bank accounts,</a> the days of free riding in the crypto market are quickly coming to an end.</p>
<p>When the veil of secrecy got pierced for holders of Swiss bank accounts, people all over the world were shocked &#8212; and suddenly a lot poorer. Crypto fans have primarily relied on the supposed anonymity of their investments to protect themselves. However, recent events have shown that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are not entirely as anonymous as advertised. It may be time to visit your enrolled agent, because it is certainly time to get out ahead of the situation.</p>
<p>Here are some tax tips for cryptocurrency investors.</p>
<h3><strong>Do Not Assume Your Account is Too Small<img class="alignright wp-image-1864" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/An-Investment-More-Important-Than-Crypto-The-Tax-the-irs-is-coming-for-you-beach-litecoin-sand-hourglass.jpg" alt="An Investment More Important Than Crypto- The Tax, the irs is coming for you, beach, litecoin, sand, hourglass" width="298" height="163" /></strong></h3>
<p>If you only have a few hundred dollars in the cryptocurrency market, you may assume that your account is too small to get the attention of the IRS. However, that is not necessarily the case. They are going to rapidly get better at sorting out the records of cryptocurrency exchanges. Pretty soon, they will likely expand their reach beyond the most significant players in the marketplace.</p>
<p>Before you know it, more and more cryptocurrency investors will become ensnared in the net of the IRS.</p>
<h3><strong>Know that All Cryptocurrencies Will Be Impacted Eventually</strong></h3>
<p>Bitcoin is the first and &#8211; by far &#8211; the most significant crypto tax target. The IRS will start poking around in other forms of virtual payment. Some cryptocurrencies may carry considerably detrimental IRS consequences. For example, there are forms of payment associated with drug purchases and other transactions on the dark web. Even if you are not doing anything wrong, your holdings in those altcoins could get the attention of the IRS and eventually generate a big tax bill.</p>
<h3><strong>Keep Careful Records</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-1865" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/An-Investment-More-Important-Than-Crypto-The-Tax-the-irs-is-coming-for-you-handheld-smartphone.jpg" alt="An Investment More Important Than Crypto- The Tax, the irs is coming for you, handheld, smartphone" width="275" height="179" />Keeping extensive and accurate records will be essential going forward. Also, you might want to go back and look at your past purchases and sales. Every transaction, including purchases using cryptocurrency as payment, could potentially be a taxable event, so good recordkeeping is vital.</p>
<p>The tax man is coming eventually, and the best thing you can do is prepare now. Waiting until the IRS catches you could mean big penalties and additional interest. The best strategy is to find a professional, like Jeffrey Schneider, EA, CTRS, that has the expertise and licensing to practice throughout the United States. He can resolve any issues involving your cryptocurrencies.</p>
