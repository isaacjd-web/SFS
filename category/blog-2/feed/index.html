<p>How to Select a Reputable Tax Resolution Company to Permanently Resolve Your Tax Problems</p>
<p>Owing back taxes is difficult and stressful. The IRS and/or State taxing authorities have the power to garnish your paycheck and freeze your bank account in order to collect what they think is their money. The IRS is the most brutal collection agency on the planet. Calling the IRS is time consuming and annoying as hold times can be longer than 30 minutes and the information you receive from them may not be correct.</p>
<p>The <strong>good news</strong> is that there are legal tax solutions to ensure that you pay the minimum amount allowed by law based on your current financial situation.</p>
<p>How to Select a Tax Resolution Company &#8211; It is important to work with a skilled tax resolution professional because they know how to present your case, in your best interest, before the IRS. Financial information has to be presented accurately the first time around. Mistakes are very costly and, in some cases, doing the wrong things can be impossible to solve; doing things right the first time is essential. You don’t get a second chance with the IRS.</p>
<p><strong>1. How many years has the professional been in business?</strong></p>
<p>You want to make sure that the professional you select has the skills, knowledge and experience to get you the results that you want.</p>
<p><strong>2. What is the professional’s ‘Track Record’?</strong></p>
<p>You only want to hire a Tax Resolution Professional with a successful track record.  Ask for specific information about the professional’s success rate.</p>
<p><strong>3. What are the professional’s qualifications?</strong></p>
<p>You should look for tax resolution companies that employ people who are licensed or certified as tax attorneys or tax resolution specialists.  CPAs often do not handle IRS tax problems.</p>
<p><strong>4. Does the professional have <u>actual experience</u> handling your type of case?</strong></p>
<p>While many attorneys and accountants have tax preparation experience, they do not possess the education, training and skills to negotiate with the IRS on a daily basis. Make sure that the professional you hire has actual, hands-on experience in solving your specific type of problem.</p>
<p><strong>5. How will the professional keep your information about your case?</strong></p>
<p>You want to be comfortable with the frequency of communications you will receive from the professional handling your case.  We generally communicate with our clients every 28 days and provide case status updates. You also want to make sure that you will receive all copies of all communication between the professional and the IRS.</p>
<p><strong>6. Is the pricing clear and easy to understand?</strong></p>
<p>An experienced and highly recommended tax resolution firm will be clear and forthright with its pricing and fee structure and tell you upfront exactly how much you can expect to pay to achieve resolution.</p>
<p><strong>7. What do clients say about his/her services?</strong></p>
<p>Please read <a href="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/testimonials-for-sfs-tax-problem-solutions/">what our clients are saying about us</a> as well as some of our <a href="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/settlements/">recent settlements</a>.</p>

			<h4><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> Valentine&#8217;s Day </strong></span></h4>
<p>Chocolates, flowers, cupid, and hearts are all associated with Valentine&#8217;s Day. According to the National Retail Federation, Americans now spend more than $20 billion lavishing gifts on their kids, friends, and significant others.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Who decided a day in the middle of February is a time to celebrate love and spend a bunch of money on gifts? The actual story of how Valentine&#8217;s Day (and its symbols) got its wings, and how much Americans spend on gifts for Valentine&#8217;s Day, might surprise you.</span></p>
<h4><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It&#8217;s named after a Catholic saint (perhaps).</span></strong></h4>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> There are stories of three different Catholic saints named Valentine, who was involved in various romantic shenanigans. The tales include conducting outlawed marriages, a secret relationship with a jailer&#8217;s daughter, and a love letter ending in &#8220;from your Valentine.&#8221; Unfortunately, all three saints met a similar fate by being put to death by Caesar. How romantic! While it&#8217;s pretty clear Valentine&#8217;s Day derives from one of these three saints, no one knows which one for sure. </span></p>
<h4><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It may have started as a <a href="https://www.learnreligions.com/valentines-day-pagan-celebrations-2562121">Pagan celebration</a>.</span></strong></h4>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Ancient Pagan festivals were often very unusual, and this one is no exception. Historians believe it involved goat and dog sacrifices, using their blood-stained animal hides, and having a drawing for a companion for the next year. It&#8217;s safe to say that everyone, especially your dog, is relieved this tradition fizzled out at some point. </span></p>
<h4><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Its primary color, red, has scientific backing.</span></strong></h4>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Giving flowers, especially red roses, is a popular romantic gesture all the way back to the Saint Valentine era. Why red? It represents passion and desire. According to a study by the University of Rochester, science ties color to behavior. The study demonstrates that men find women wearing red attire more attractive. </span></p>
<h4><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Americans spend an average of $162 on gifts.</span></strong></h4>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While the percentage of Americans who celebrate Valentine&#8217;s Day has declined over the past decade (63% of Americans celebrated the holiday in 2009 compared to 51% in 2019), those who do celebrate Valentine&#8217;s Day spent an average of $162 on gifts in 2019 compared to $103 in 2009.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Knowing the history of this holiday and how much money the average consumer spends on gifts for this special day adds context to the holiday. However, recreating the actual events is probably not a great idea. Instead, give your loved ones a hug, and a treat.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Have a wonderful Day!</span></p>

		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>Of all the creditors or companies, you might owe money to, the Internal Revenue Service can be the least forgiving about debt. If you don&#8217;t pay your taxes, the IRS will levy and take possession of your property, including cash accounts, wages, and real and personal property. The IRS will sell non-liquid assets to raise funds to satisfy the debt you owe.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If you&#8217;ve received a levy notice from the IRS, it&#8217;s time to ACT IMMEDIATELY. Our firm may be able to get your levy released the same day, but you must call now for a confidential consultation. 877-355-8010 or   <a href="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/contact-us-at-sfs-tax-problem-solutions-in-stuart/">https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/contact-us-at-sfs-tax-problem-solutions-in-stuart/</a></span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Unless you don&#8217;t open your mail or you moved without leaving a forwarding address, you probably won&#8217;t be blindsided by an IRS levy. You&#8217;ll receive a &#8220;Notice and Demand for Payment&#8221; of your tax debt well in advance of any action taken. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If you ignore this notice, the IRS will follow up by sending you a &#8220;Final Notice of Intent to Levy and Notice of Your Rights to a Hearing.&#8221; Now the clock begins ticking. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">You have 30 days to pay your tax debt or to contact the IRS to try to stop the levy. Even if you&#8217;re unaware of the levy proceedings, your employer has a little bit of time to warn you if he receives notice that the IRS plans to take the bulk (which can be up to 90%) of your paychecks. Your employer doesn&#8217;t have to begin sending your earnings to the IRS until the next pay period. With any luck, your employer will let you know what&#8217;s going on within this time frame so that you can take action. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If the IRS levies your bank account, the bank will freeze the money in the account and remit it to the IRS after 21 days. Therefore, you must act quickly to try to have the funds released upon receiving a notice that the IRS has levied your bank account. </span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Contact A Tax Relief Firm</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Now is not the time to do it alone. If you call the IRS, they will often trick you into giving incriminating answers, further distancing you for the tax relief you so desperately need. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The IRS is NOT your friend. They are there to collect what they believe you owe in taxes. Contact a professional experienced in tax resolution to help you with your case. Would you go to court without a lawyer? Well, it&#8217;s the same with the IRS. You need professional representation from an Enrolled Agent, CPA, or tax attorney who is also a tax resolution specialist.</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Establish Hardship </span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If the IRS intends to levy your paycheck or Social Security benefits and you can&#8217;t come close to making ends meet on what&#8217;s left, the IRS wants you to contact them. The contact phone number should appear on the levy notice. DO NOT CALL THE IRS.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The law requires that the IRS leave you with the total of your tax exemptions for the year plus your standard deduction divided by 52 if you&#8217;re paid weekly. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Gather your documents and call us. We&#8217;ll help make the case to the IRS and explain that the levy will cause hardship for you and your family. You&#8217;ll have to provide documented evidence of this, but if you do, the IRS will release the levy. This doesn&#8217;t mean you no longer owe the tax. It just means that the IRS will leave your earnings and income alone and work with you to figure out some other way for you to satisfy the debt. </span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Make Payment Arrangements </span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">We can also ask for payment terms for your tax debt even if the levy won&#8217;t cripple you financially. If you enter into an installment agreement, the IRS will typically release the levy unless the notice you received specifically states otherwise. </span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">You Can &#8220;Settle&#8221; For Less Than You Owe</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">An offer in compromise allows you to settle your tax debt for less than the full amount you owe. It may be a legitimate option if you can&#8217;t pay your full tax liability or doing so creates a financial hardship. The IRS considers your unique set of facts and circumstances:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Ability to pay;</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Income;</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Expenses; and</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Asset equity.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The IRS will generally approve an offer in compromise when the amount offered represents the most they can expect to collect within a reasonable period of time. It&#8217;s best to explore all other payment options before submitting an offer in compromise as the Offer in Compromise program is not for everyone. Make sure you hire a tax professional to help you file an offer and be sure to check his or her qualifications.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The IRS doesn&#8217;t want to destroy you financially. They just want the money they are owed. If you can make an arrangement to pay or prove that you don&#8217;t owe the tax, or if you legitimately cannot pay it at this time, you may be able to make the levy go away. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Our firm specializes in tax resolution, even if you have years of unfiled tax returns, we can help! If you want a Certified Tax Resolution Specialist who knows how to navigate the IRS maze, reach out to our firm and we&#8217;ll schedule a no-obligation confidential consultation to explain your options to permanently resolve your tax problem. <a href="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/contact-us-at-sfs-tax-problem-solutions-in-stuart/">https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/contact-us-at-sfs-tax-problem-solutions-in-stuart/ </a></span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Three Tax Resolution Strategies Offered by the IRS</strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Taxes are a fact of life, but tax problems aren’t. If you find yourself in tax trouble, the IRS has definitive guidelines for how to proceed in collecting what they believe you owe them. After sending you notices, the IRS can garnish your wages, levy your bank account, even put a lien on your property. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, the IRS also has tax relief options for taxpayers. In this blog, we will provide the three strategies offered by the IRS to resolve your tax debt.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Note, we always recommend getting in touch with a tax resolution specialist to help avoid the harsh penalties and interest that accrued on your back taxes. It’s far easier to navigate towards tax resolution if you have a professional working with you. If you’d like to schedule a no-cost confidential tax relief consultation, contact us at <a href="http://bit.ly/2Hh7cEl"><em>http://bit.ly/2Hh7cEl</em></a></span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Let’s review the three tax relief options:</span></p>
<h5><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">1. Penalty Abatement (PA) &#8211; If I Can’t Afford to Pay My Taxes, Why do They Keep Adding Penalties?</span></strong></h5>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The IRS doesn’t like being ignored, so adding penalties is a way for them to grab and keep your attention. They want to be sure you know they are not going away. If you don’t respond to the initial notice, they add penalties (and interest). Penalties are just the beginning of what they can do to your life. You should also be aware that there are several penalties which the IRS can assess at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The IRS may provide administrative relief from a penalty that would otherwise be applicable under its First Time Penalty Abatement policy. To see if you qualify, call our firm at 877.355.8010 at <a href="http://bit.ly/2Hh7cEl">http://bit.ly/2Hh7cEl</a></span></p>
<h5><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">2. Offer in Compromise (OIC) &#8211; Pay Less Than You Owe </span></strong></h5>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">You’ve probably seen the tax relief firms advertising this on Radio and TV as a way to settle your tax debt for less than the full amount. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Not everyone qualifies, however. It’s essential to get expert help, so your offer has a higher chance of being accepted. Before you submit an offer, you must make sure that you’re in compliance by filing delinquent tax returns. Then correctly structuring your offer in a way that the IRS will accept it. Having someone who’s negotiated these offers like our firm is indispensable. Think of it this way; would you go to court without a lawyer? Of course not. Well, it’s the same thing here. You need an experienced IRS tax problem solver to represent you before the IRS.</span></p>
<h5><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">3. Get on A Properly Structured Payment Plan</span></strong></h5>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Your specific tax situation will determine which payment options are available to you. Payment options include full payment, a short-term payment plan (paying in 120 days or less), or a long-term payment plan (installment agreement) (paying in more than 120 days).</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It’s important to structure your payment plan properly. SFS. Tax Problem Solutions can help you set up an Installment Agreement (IA) or Partial Payment Installment Agreement (PPIA) depending on your situation</span></p>
<h5><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Here’s How We Help You Get Your Life Back</span></strong></h5>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Some people don’t know what returns have to be filed or what they owe: their personal or business bookkeeping and recordkeeping is a mess or non-existent. After we register our Power of Attorney with the IRS and get you protected, the second step we take is to get all your IRS tax records from the IRS to see where you stand. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">After that, with your help, we prepare all your delinquent income tax returns and get them filed with IRS. And lastly, we negotiate the best possible resolution that permanently solves your IRS difficulties. That may mean negotiating an Offer in Compromise, a writing a properly structured Payment Plan, determining a Currently Not Collectible Status, effecting a Penalty Reduction, and more.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Most of this takes place without you ever coming to our offices. We live in a day and age where technology makes it easy for us to represent you no matter where you reside. Of course, you can always come to our offices if you prefer, whatever is more convenient for you.  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Believe it or not, some laws have gone into effect to help financially strapped taxpayers. The IRS announced its “Fresh Start Initiative,” which allows more taxpayers than ever before to settle with the agency. Now is the time to take advantage of these less-stringent, more flexible programs before the IRS changes its mind again.    </span></p>

<h5 style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><span style="color: #1c1e29;">Why is resolving your tax problem on your own or preparing your business tax return an awful idea?</span></span></strong></h5>
<h5 style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><span style="color: #1c1e29;"> </span></span></h5>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><span style="color: #1c1e29;">Running your own business means wearing a lot of hats, from janitor and head of HR to client schmoozer and marketing director. But should you add the role of tax preparer to your already long list of duties? What if you have a tax problem with the IRS? What if preparing your own taxes creates a tax problem?</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><span style="color: #1c1e29;"> </span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><span style="color: #1c1e29;">In our practice, we regularly see many small business clients. Clients come in with tax problems. They may have a schedule C, or a corporation, partnership, or LLC, with payroll and income tax problems, or they were flagged for an audit. Simply because they thought they could do it on their own. It’s so not a good idea.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><span style="color: #1c1e29;"> </span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><span style="color: #1c1e29;">If you prepared your taxes when you were an employee or freelancer, you might think that preparing the tax return for your small business is no big deal. There are plenty of great tools on the market, from expensive tracking apps for your devices to software such as QuickBooks for your computer. But before you start scanning your receipts and filling out all of those forms, you might want to reconsider. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><span style="color: #1c1e29;"> </span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><span style="color: #1c1e29;">Note; we encourage all readers facing an IRS or state tax problem to contact us for a FREE, no-obligation, confidential consultation at </span><a href="http://bit.ly/2Hh7cEl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #4a6ee0;">http://bit.ly/2Hh7cEl</span></a>. Or schedule your appointment online at https<a href="https://meetme.so/SFSTax."><u>://meetme.so/SFSTax.</u></a><em> </em> We can also help you with unfiled tax returns for previous years and get your business back into compliance.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><span style="color: #1c1e29;">Even if you think you can, preparing your business taxes on your own, it is not in your best interest. Resolving your tax problem is an even worse idea. Here are some of the reasons you should leave the filing of your business tax returns and resolving your business IRS tax problem to the professionals.</span></span></p>
<h5><strong><img class="alignright wp-image-4586" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Magnifying-glass-Not-a-good-idea-preparing-your-tax-return.-books-300x158.png" alt="magnifying glass with books" width="414" height="217" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Magnifying-glass-Not-a-good-idea-preparing-your-tax-return.-books-300x158.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Magnifying-glass-Not-a-good-idea-preparing-your-tax-return.-books-768x404.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Magnifying-glass-Not-a-good-idea-preparing-your-tax-return.-books.png 1000w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Magnifying-glass-Not-a-good-idea-preparing-your-tax-return.-books-700x368.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px" /></strong></h5>
<h5><strong>It is Easy to Make a Mistake</strong></h5>
<p>Even a small business tax return can be a multitude of pages, and many returns are even more complicated than that. With so many numbers and so much information, you have thousands of opportunities to make a mistake.</p>
<p>Even a small mistake could have dire consequences for your small business, and doing your own taxes puts you at risk. Inadvertent blunders could mean paying more taxes than you should or cost you in penalties and interest. At worst, these errors could trigger an audit and tie your business up for months. If you owe back taxes, the IRS can put a levy on your bank account and put a lien on your property until you pay up.<strong> </strong></p>
<h5><strong> </strong><strong>The Tax Laws Are Always Changing</strong></h5>
<p>Last year our tax laws had some of the most dramatic changes seen in the previous thirty years. The tax code is already one of the most complex documents ever written, with more words than the Bible and complexities at every turn. Those laws are not static; they are always changing. Think qualified Business Income Deduction or Specified Service Trade Or Business.</p>
<p>Even if you are an expert on the current tax code, that expertise will not last long. Every new year brings a slew of new tax changes, and many of them will directly impact your small business. If you rely on your expertise and your technological tools, you could miss an important update that could save your firm money or help you avoid the wrath of the IRS. If you recall, Congress just passed the Secure Act on December 20, 2019, and reenacted the “extenders.” Some retroactive to 2018.</p>
<h5><strong>You, Will, Be on Your Own in Case of Audit</strong></h5>
<p>As an individual taxpayer, your chances of being audited are less than 1%, but as a business owner, filing a schedule C the odds are far higher. The IRS is increasingly setting its sights on the small business community, and that means you have a target on your back.</p>
<p>Even if you do everything correctly, you have a good chance of being audited sooner or later. And if you prepare your taxes, you could be on your own when the IRS comes calling.</p>
<p>Audit defense and IRS representation is a specialized skill set which 95% of CPA’s don’t have. We always recommend hiring an experienced and reputable tax resolution firm like ours, who deals with the IRS for a living, day-in, day-out.</p>
<h5><strong><img class="alignright wp-image-4587" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/When-a-tax-pro-is-needed-300x158.png" alt="Jeffrey Schneider in cell phone frame with credentials" width="402" height="211" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/When-a-tax-pro-is-needed-300x158.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/When-a-tax-pro-is-needed-768x404.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/When-a-tax-pro-is-needed.png 1000w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/When-a-tax-pro-is-needed-700x368.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 402px) 100vw, 402px" />The Expertise You Gain When Hiring A Pro is Well Worth the Cost</strong></h5>
<p>Having your business taxes prepared by a tax professional can be expensive. Depending on the size and complexity of the return, you could pay several hundred dollars to several thousand, to have the returns prepared correctly.</p>
<p>Even so, this is one expense you should be eager to incur. If you do your own business taxes and make a mistake, even a single error could cost you many times the fee you’ll pay to have it done right. So, do yourself and your business a favor; leave your taxes to the experts.</p>
<p>Running a small business is tough enough. The last thing you want to do is add more tasks to your already busy plate or getting into tax trouble. If you are still doing your business tax returns, it may be time to hand off this vital service to a professional.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4><strong>Unfiled Tax Returns? &#8211; What to do.</strong></h4>
<p>7 million taxpayers failed to file their taxes in 2014. No one is keen on filing their taxes, but not filing them at all is never a wise move. The Internal Revenue Service is a powerful collection agency. They are also relentless in their pursuit of what is owed to them. Getting on the wrong side of the IRS and having years of unfiled or back taxes is one of the worst moves you can make.</p>
<p>No matter what the reason, if you have unfiled tax returns, it is time to rectify the situation. It is only a matter of time before the IRS catches up with you and demands that the back taxes be paid. Often times, the amount they claim you owe will be far greater than the amount you actually owe and it’s up to you to prove otherwise.</p>
<p>Before we get into it, if you have a tax problem or years of unfiled tax returns, contact our firm for a consultation <em>www.sfstaxacct.com or schedule a consultation, </em><a href="https://go.oncehub.com/jeffreyschneider" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>https://go.oncehub.com/jeffreyschneider</em></a><em>. </em>You won’t have to talk to the IRS and our firm can provide the peace of mind you need to resolve your tax issue.</p>
<p>The faster you act, the better off you will be. Here are some key steps to take if you have unfiled returns with the IRS.</p>
<h5><strong>What about Documentation?</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>If you have unfiled tax returns and are ready to make things right with the IRS, gather whatever records you can, and a Certified Tax Resolution<img class="alignright wp-image-4427" title="Unfiled Taxes? What to do." src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Unfiled-tax-returns-sfs-tax-problem-solutions-1-300x158.png" alt="tax forms-1040, w-9,sfs tax problem solutions" width="363" height="191" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Unfiled-tax-returns-sfs-tax-problem-solutions-1-300x158.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Unfiled-tax-returns-sfs-tax-problem-solutions-1-768x404.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Unfiled-tax-returns-sfs-tax-problem-solutions-1.png 1000w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Unfiled-tax-returns-sfs-tax-problem-solutions-1-700x368.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 363px) 100vw, 363px" /> Specialist (CTRS) will do the rest. Even if you don’t have much in the way of old documentation, there are ways to construct your income and expenses even when no records exist or have been lost or destroyed due to natural disasters.</li>
<li>If you are missing W2 and 1099 forms from past years an experienced tax resolution pro has the ability to retrieve these.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Run the Numbers</strong></h5>
<p>The fear of high taxes has caused many a taxpayer to forgo filing their returns, but those worries are often unfounded. According to IRS statistics, a surprising number of unfiled returns may actually be due a refund. Even if you don’t get a refund because you didn’t withhold any taxes, you will likely have better payment options for your back taxes by working with a tax resolution firm like ours as opposed to doing it on your own.</p>
<p>Now that you have all the documentation you need; it is time to run the numbers. And while you may not be able to get exact figures without filing the returns, you can get an idea of how much you might owe.</p>
<h5><strong>Work with a Professional</strong></h5>
<p>Having unfiled tax returns can put your financial life, and possibly your freedom, at risk. And while the desire to file those old tax returns and pay what you owe is commendable, now is not the time to go it alone.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-4429" title="Unfiled Taxes? What to do?" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/CTRS-300x158.png" alt="CTRS and client reviewing tax return" width="372" height="196" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/CTRS-300x158.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/CTRS-768x404.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/CTRS.png 1000w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/CTRS-700x368.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 372px) 100vw, 372px" /></p>
<p>When it comes time to file those unfiled tax returns and get right with the IRS, you need a qualified professional in your corner. A Certified Tax Resolution Specialist can give you the advice and guidance you need, from gathering the proper documents to filling out the necessary paperwork.</p>
<h5>What is a CTRS?</h5>
<p>A Certified Tax Resolution Specialist (CTRS) is a tax expert who helps clients deal with tax issues and represents them before the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).</p>
<p>Dealing with the IRS can be frightening, but not dealing with the tax agency could be even worse. Not filing your tax returns does not mean the IRS has forgotten about you; just the contrary. The IRS keeps detailed records, and chances are they have already noticed your lack of compliance. So, do yourself and your finances a favor and file your returns as soon as possible.</p>
<p>It is very likely that you will need expert help and guidance to file those back taxes, and finding the right professional is a great place to start. A CTRS can help you make things right with the IRS. File your back taxes and move on with the rest of your life.</p>
<p>Just knowing that you have unfiled tax returns can be a source of stress. Even if you think you can continue to fly under the IRS radar, you never know when they will reach out to you. Do yourself a favor by filing those back tax returns now; it is not as scary as you think.</p>
<p>If you are in tax trouble, reach out to our tax resolution firm and we’ll schedule a free, no-obligation confidential consultation to explain your options in full to permanently resolve your tax problem.

			<h4>2020, The Year You Deal With Your Back Taxes!</h4>
<p>Deal With Your Back Taxes. According to the IRS, more than 13.2 million Americans owe back taxes. The majority of these cases involve amounts that seem impossible to pay off.</p>
<p>That leaves those tax-owing folks in a difficult position. They want to pay, but they can&#8217;t, and the end result is feeling a lot of guilt about the situation.  There is no easy way to get out of paying your back taxes. Uncle Sam wants his money, and he&#8217;ll get it somehow.</p>
<p>There are steps you can take to find a solution and make 2020 the year you finally deal with your taxes.</p>
<p>Note, we always recommend getting in touch with a Certified Tax Resolution Specialist to negotiate with the IRS on your behalf. If you’d like to schedule a no-cost confidential tax relief consultation, contact us here. <a href="https://meetme.so/SFSTax"><strong>https://meetme.so/SFSTax</strong></a> or call 877.355.8010</p>
<h4><strong>Why Now Is the Right Time to Deal with Back Taxes</strong><strong><img class="alignright wp-image-4308" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Now-Is-the-Right-Time-to-Deal-with-Back-Taxes-1-300x158.png" alt="Deal With Your Back Taxes-finances-hpuse-sfstaxproblemsolutions" width="372" height="196" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Now-Is-the-Right-Time-to-Deal-with-Back-Taxes-1-300x158.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Now-Is-the-Right-Time-to-Deal-with-Back-Taxes-1-768x404.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Now-Is-the-Right-Time-to-Deal-with-Back-Taxes-1.png 1000w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Now-Is-the-Right-Time-to-Deal-with-Back-Taxes-1-700x368.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 372px) 100vw, 372px" /></strong></h4>
<p><strong>#1 You&#8217;ll End Up Owing Less</strong></p>
<p>The longer you wait to pay your back taxes, the more you are going to end up owing. That&#8217;s because the IRS can and will add penalties that can add up quickly.   The longer you drag out the situation, the more you&#8217;ll need to pay your tax resolution specialist to help you handle everything. The sooner you act, the sooner you can resolve the issue and the less you&#8217;ll have to pay.</p>
<p>If you need help from a CPA, Enrolled Agent or a lawyer who is also a tax resolution professional, look for someone that will charge you a flat fee rather than an hourly rate. Some cases take longer to resolve, so it’s important to know up front what you’ll be paying in service fees to get your back-tax issue resolved.</p>
<p><strong>#2 Housing prices are at an all-time high. Time to cash in?</strong></p>
<p>If you own your home or have equity in it, selling it and downsizing may be the best way to settle your tax debt and get a clean slate. Now is a perfect time, too, with housing prices at a premium in many areas of the country. You can use that cash in the bank to settle your back taxes almost immediately. Additionally, if your home is worth more than you owe, you can then reinvest that money or save it for a rainy day. That gives you a clean financial slate to start rebuilding your life.</p>
<p><strong>#3 Economic Uncertainty</strong></p>
<p>Most experts agree we’re due for a recession soon. How soon? Well, no one knows. What we do know is that having a large back tax bill will only hinder your ability to weather a storm in the event of an economic downturn.</p>
<p>You might be able to take a low interest loan out now that the economy is still good and settle your tax bill. Taking care of your taxes while the economy is still good will give you peace of mind and breathing room in case things go south with the economy.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Resolve Your Back Taxes Permanently</h4>
<p>When you owe money to the IRS, it is hard to think about anything else. While being in debt is never fun, no matter who the creditor is, the IRS enjoys almost unlimited power to collect the money they are due.</p>
<p>Unlike your mortgage lender or credit card company, the Internal Revenue Service has the power to attach your wages, raid your bank account and even take your freedom. No other creditor even comes close in terms of its power and influence and taking on the agency on your own could be asking for trouble.</p>
<p>If you have received a notice from the IRS, you need to act fast, and you need the right assistance in your corner. Taking on the IRS requires specific expertise, and that is why it is so important to work with a quality tax resolution company. Here are nine reasons why working with a tax resolution service could save your good name &#8211; and your bank account.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>You gain specific expertise.</strong> The IRS is a specialized agency, and you need expert advice and guidance to get the most positive resolution.</li>
<li><strong>It will give you peace of mind.</strong> Just being contacted by the IRS can make your heart beat a bit faster but working with a tax resolution expert can set your mind at ease once you hire a tax resolution. Generally, once you hire a tax resolution expert you won’t have to meet or speak with the IRS.</li>
<li><strong>The tax resolution process could save you a lot of money.</strong> Tax resolution agents are experts at settlements and working with one could save you a ton of money.</li>
<li><strong>Timely action could save your home and property. </strong>If you wait too long, you could put your home, business, bank accounts and personal property at risk. Time is of the essence when it comes to resolving tax issues, and timely assistance could make a world of difference.</li>
<li><strong>You will feel less alone.</strong> Few things feel as lonely as fighting the IRS on your own. When you work with a tax resolution specialist, not only do you not have to go it alone, but they actually step into your shoes and to represent your best interests.</li>
<li><strong>You will have a chance to file missing returns.</strong> When faced with a big tax bill, it is easy to do nothing, but failing to file tax returns could have serious consequences down the line. If you have years of unfiled returns, a tax resolution expert can help you catch up.</li>
<li><strong>Expert help could make an audit less scary. </strong>Receiving that audit notice in the mail can be pretty frightening, but a tax resolution expert can guide you through the process. When you work with a tax resolution professional, you will have one less thing to worry about.</li>
<li><strong>You could save your credit score.</strong> Unresolved issues with the IRS will reflect badly on your credit report, lowering your credit score and making it harder to borrow money or qualify for a mortgage. Timely tax resolution could preserve your stellar credit score and help you avoid those serious consequences.</li>
</ol>
<p>Owing money to the IRS can be pretty frightening. There is a reason those three letters strike so much fear into the hearts of ordinary citizens, even those who have done nothing wrong.</p>
<p>If you are in trouble with the IRS, you cannot afford to ignore the issue, so act fast and get the help you need today. Working with a tax resolution specialist carries a host of benefits, starting with the nine outlined above.</p>
<p>Reach out to our firm and we’ll schedule a no-obligation confidential consultation to explain your options in full to permanently resolve your tax problem. Visit our website, <em><a href="http://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/">sfstaxproblemsolutions.com</a> or call us at 877.355.8010.</em></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you owe back taxes the IRS can make your life miserable. Have you received a Notice from the IRS only to leave it on your kitchen counter, desk, or worse, hide it under a stack of bills? Unfortunately, those letters from the IRS will just keep coming. Your problem won’t go away on its own.</p>
<p>If you don’t take action now, the IRS WILL keep piling on penalties and interest…and interest on top of the penalties&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-782" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/IRS-enve-305x172-300x169.jpg" alt="If-you-owe-back-taxes-the-IRS-can-make-your-life-miserable-irs-envelope" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/IRS-enve-305x172-300x169.jpg 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/IRS-enve-305x172.jpg 305w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The IRS doesn’t like being ignored, so this is how they get your attention. They want to be sure you know they are not going away. It’s like they haunt you with their ongoing letters. If you don’t respond to them the penalties they tack on is like a club they keep hitting you over the head with. Penalties are just the beginning of what they can do to your life.</p>
<h4>But that’s just the beginning.</h4>
<p>The IRS has a lot of power over your life. They not only can freeze your bank accounts—that’s right—but they can seize all the money in your bank accounts as well.</p>
<p>The agency can garnish your wages and<em> can legally take as much as 90% of your net paycheck.</em> Can you live on 10% of your net pay? The IRS thinks and expects you can!</p>
<p>Besides slapping Bank Levies and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garnishment#Wages">Wage Garnishments</a> on you, they can put a lien on your house, making it nearly impossible to borrow against it to pay the IRS off. And if you sell your house, the IRS gets their money first from any equity left over.</p>
<p>If you owe back taxes the IRS can make your life miserable.  Federal Tax Liens prevent you from borrowing any money—except for those high-charging money stores located in mini-malls. An IRS lien makes it harder to rent an apartment, get a car, obtain any kind of credit; An IRS Lien can even jeopardize your job!</p>
<p>And believe it or not, the IRS has the authority to show up and knock on your door! Make no mistake—the IRS is the most brutal collection agency on the planet.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-3003 alignleft" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Tax-Lien-300x158.jpg" alt="I-received- a notice-of federal-tax-lien-notice-hand-pen" width="351" height="185" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Tax-Lien-300x158.jpg 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Tax-Lien-768x404.jpg 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Tax-Lien-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Tax-Lien-700x368.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 351px) 100vw, 351px" /></p>
<p>If you owe between $10,000 and $250,000 plus, the IRS has many NEW flexible programs available to taxpayers. To name but a few: Offer in Compromise, Partial Pay Installment Agreements, Payment Plans, Penalty Reduction, and Currently Not Collectible Status.  Each carries with it its own unique process, procedures, and qualifications. Having an experienced Certified Tax Resolution Specialist in your corner ensures you are taking advantage of the best options available to you.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>How to Recognize an IRS Tax Scam and What to Do if the Tax Due Notice is Real</h4>
<p>Is My Tax Notice Real? Hearing from the IRS is bad enough but being contacted by a scammer posing as the IRS is even worse. Or at least just annoying and frightening. IRS scams are everywhere these days, and they take many different forms. Even sophisticated taxpayers have been fooled by these crooks, sometimes losing thousands of dollars in the process.</p>
<p>In other words, if you do not want to be the next victim, you need to educate yourself about how these scams originate, what forms they take, and how the perpetrators prey on an inherent fear of the IRS.</p>
<h4>Here are some warning signs to look out for when someone claiming to be from the IRS comes calling.</h4>
<ol>
<li> The tax bill comes out of the blue. Notices of taxes due are rarely surprises. If you have always paid your taxes on time, a past due notice or other scare tactics should be met with skepticism.</li>
<li> The &#8220;agent&#8221; threatens to have you arrested. IRS agents are scary, but they will not threaten you with arrest or imprisonment before the audit process has even begun.</li>
<li> You are offered relief in exchange for immediate payment. The process of paying overdue taxes and resolving tax disputes is long and complicated. Offers of an immediate settlement are common signs of a scam.</li>
<li> The caller asks you to pay your bill with gift cards. The IRS does not accept iTunes gift cards or prepaid phone cards as payment for taxes due. If the &#8220;agent&#8221; on the other end of the line asks for these payments, just hang up.</li>
<li>You receive a phone call or a message on your cell phone. The IRS does not use phone calls as a primary means of communication. If you are not in current negotiations with the IRS, the tax agency will never call you.</li>
<li>The communication comes via email. If you owe money to the IRS or the agency has questions about your return, they will contact you via U.S. mail. Notices of tax due that come in the form of email are always scams &#8211; and the emails themselves often harbor dangerous viruses and other malware.</li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, if you wish to better understand the tax notice you receive, check out my first book, Now What? I Got a Tax Notice From the IRS. Help! available on <a href="http://amzn.to/2phfdQE">Amazon</a>.</p>
<h4>Is My Tax Notice Real?</h4>
<p>Now that you know how to spot an IRS collection scam, what happens if the communication is real? What should you do if you do receive a snail mail notice saying you owe additional taxes? Here are some critical steps to take if that dreaded letter shows up in your mailbox.</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft wp-image-3972" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/hands-forms-reaching--300x300.png" alt="Is my tax notice real hands reaching for help" width="295" height="295" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/hands-forms-reaching--300x300.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/hands-forms-reaching--150x150.png 150w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/hands-forms-reaching-.png 381w" sizes="(max-width: 295px) 100vw, 295px" />Contact A Tax Resolution Professional</strong></p>
<p>If you owe back taxes to the IRS, there are some definite benefits to hiring a tax resolution service. These companies exist for a reason, and they can provide a way out for taxpayers who feel overwhelmed by the whole process.</p>
<p>Negotiating with the IRS on your own can be intimidating, and the tax agency may not offer you the best terms. Experienced tax resolution firms are used to dealing with the IRS, and more often than not, they can get you a better deal.</p>
<p><strong>Verify Their Contact Information or Contact the IRS Directly </strong></p>
<p>While it is uncommon, some scammer is using the U.S. mail to perpetrate their schemes. Before you write a check, contact the IRS and make sure the communication is legitimate.</p>
<p>It would help if you looked up the IRS phone number at their website irs.gov, instead of simply calling the phone number in the letter you received. If the letter is a scam, the phone number provided will send you to the perpetrators of the fraud. If you want to know the truth, contact the IRS directly.</p>
<p><strong>Think About How Much You Can Afford to Pay</strong></p>
<p>Paying a huge tax bill is sure to be a burden, even for middle and upper-class taxpayers. If you know you cannot afford to pay the entire amount due, think about how much you can pay. You have options &#8211; either in monthly installments or all at once.</p>
<p>The tax agency is often willing to work with taxpayers to pay off the amount they owe; payment plans are common. However, if you plan to go this route, it pays to seek professional help. An experienced tax resolution expert can help you work out a compromise or payment plan you can afford.</p>
<p><strong>Take Interest and Penalties into Account<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3908" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2019-taxpayer-roadmap-300x296.jpg" alt="IRS road map maze" width="300" height="296" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2019-taxpayer-roadmap-300x296.jpg 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2019-taxpayer-roadmap.jpg 611w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></strong></p>
<p>If you receive a notice of additional taxes due, time is of the essence. In other words, once that notice goes out, the clock starts ticking, and your interest and penalties can add up fast.</p>
<p>Above all, the sooner you act, the sooner you can start to settle your obligation, so you can set your mind at ease and get on with the rest of your life. No one likes to owe money to the IRS, and simply being contacted can be enough to set your heart pounding. If you do find yourself in such a situation, it pays to act fast and seek the help of an experienced tax settlement professional.</p>
<h4>What to Do if the Tax Due Notice is Real</h4>
