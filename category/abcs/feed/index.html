			<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> I is for Innocent/Injured Spouse Relief &#8211; The Takeaway: When you file a joint return, you and your spouse share in the responsibility to pay the tax. The IRS can collect against each of you together or separately. This is called &#8220;joint ad several liability.&#8221; But what if the tax debt is not yours.</span></p>
<h5><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Diffe</span></strong><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">rences between Injured Spouse vs. Innocent Spouse</span></strong></h5>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Innocent spouse relief might be extended when your current or former spouse fails to report income, reported income improperly, or claimed improper deductions and credits. To qualify as an innocent spouse, the IRS says you must </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">meet all</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> of the following requirements:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">You filed a joint return that had an understatement of tax (deficiency) that’s wholly credited to your spouse’s erroneous item. Erroneous items include the income received by your spouse but omitted from the return, as well as incorrectly reported deductions, credits, and property basis.</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">You establish that when you signed the return that you didn’t know and had no reason to know, that there was an understatement of tax.</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Allowing for all pertinent facts, it would be unfair to hold you liable for the understatement of tax.</span></li>
</ul>
<h5><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In summary, an innocent spouse is married to someone who, on their joint tax return, deliberately lied to the federal government by hiding or misreporting income or claimed too many write-offs to lower their tax bill. </span></h5>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If you had no idea about this understatement at the time you signed your tax return form, the government doesn’t think you should be held accountable for the penalty. It might qualify you for innocent spouse relief from joint and several liability.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In contrast, an injured spouse is someone whose tax refund is used to cover the financial obligations of a current or former spouse. You would be an injured spouse if your share of the overpayment shown on your joint return was, or is expected to be, applied (offset) against your spouse’s legally enforceable past-due debts. To be considered an injured spouse, you must have paid federal income tax or claimed refundable tax credit, such as the Earned Income Credit or Additional Child Tax Credit on the joint return, and not be legally obligated to pay the debt of the spouse.</span></p>
<h5><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4825" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Injured-Spouse-vs-Innocent-Spouse-Relief-300x251.png" alt="I is for Injured/Innocent Spouse Relief" width="300" height="251" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Injured-Spouse-vs-Innocent-Spouse-Relief-300x251.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Injured-Spouse-vs-Innocent-Spouse-Relief-768x644.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Injured-Spouse-vs-Innocent-Spouse-Relief-700x587.png 700w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Injured-Spouse-vs-Innocent-Spouse-Relief.png 940w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Rules for Injured Spouse vs. Innocent Spouse</span></h5>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If you file a joint return with your spouse, the IRS will not automatically distinguish between you and your partner when collecting tax dollars from either of you, even if your spouse’s debt existed well before the marriage. The IRS has the legal right to offset some or all of a refund to apply to unpaid financial responsibilities such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Federal taxes</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">State income taxes</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">State unemployment compensation debts</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Child or spousal support payments</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Federal nontax debt, such as defaulted student loans</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">When the IRS applies a person’s refund to past liability, they will mail a formal Notice of Offset to the taxpayer’s address. At this time, the taxpayer whose refund was seized or offset has the opportunity to file an injured spouse claim. </span></p>
<h5><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> I is for Innocent/Injured Spouse Relief </span></h5>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Innocent spouses face more severe problems than injured spouses. When you complete a tax return, you sign your return with penalties under perjury. Even if you were unaware of your spouse’s understatement, the IRS counts this misrepresentation as tax fraud and imposes serious consequences for it. Legally, if the IRS suspects fraud in your joint return, the IRS can:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Impose Penalties and Fees</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Make Criminal Charges</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">For relief of liability from the above penalties, you can file an innocent spouse claim. The innocent spouse rule stipulates that you must have signed and filed a joint return without full knowledge of your spouse’s real financial situation. Married persons who did not file joint returns, but live in community property states, may also qualify for innocent spouse relief. </span></p>
<p>When deciding on the situation that is best for you, you need to make sure you know the differences between innocent and injured spouse as they are very different.</p>

			<p>Handing an IRS Audit &#8211; IRS audits are rare these days. State tax authorities also conduct audits. Sometimes tax audits are random, but the IRS usually selects taxpayers based on suspicious activity.</p>
<p>Most <a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/irs-audits">IRS audits</a> are done by mail and are much less intrusive than the dreaded audit where the taxpayer personally meets with the IRS at their office (called an &#8220;office&#8221; or &#8220;desk&#8221; audit) or at the taxpayer&#8217;s home or place of business (called a &#8220;field&#8221; audit). <a href="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs-tax-problem-solutions/the-sfs-team/">Working with us</a> means you generally do not speak or meet with the IRS.</p>
<p>The IRS audited almost 1.0 million tax returns, approximately 0.5 percent of all returns filed in Calendar Year 2017. Or 1 in 184 taxpayers were selected for audit. For taxpayers filing individual tax returns, the likelihood of audit is 1 in 161. <em> </em>Filing your return accurately and honestly can reduce your chances of being selected and increase the odds of a favorable outcome.</p>
<p><em>According to IRS statistics, people in higher tax brackets and people who report no income at all get the most attention. </em> Those earning more than $1 million were audited at a 4.4 percent rate. If you&#8217;re a high earner, know that you may hear from the IRS.</p>
<h4><img class="alignright wp-image-4778 size-medium" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Red-flag-and-audits-300x158.png" alt="Handling an IRS Audit -A sign that says Red Flag, ripped paper that says Audit and words saying - Audits are Rare." width="300" height="158" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Red-flag-and-audits-300x158.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Red-flag-and-audits-768x404.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Red-flag-and-audits.png 1000w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Red-flag-and-audits-700x368.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Here are thirteen of the biggest red flags that are likely to land you in the IRS audit radar.</h4>
<ol>
<li>You aren&#8217;t reporting cryptocurrency &#8211; When you buy something with cryptocurrency, it&#8217;s a taxable transaction. The IRS receives information from digital currency wallet Coinbase and may apply increased review to your tax return if it doesn&#8217;t reflect the data provided.</li>
<li>Failing to report all of your income &#8211; You may want to submit only your W-2 form from your primary job and keep the freelance job income on your Form 1099 to yourself. The IRS already knows about income that appears on your W-2 and1099 income forms because the company you worked for a submitted copy to the IRS. It&#8217;s only a matter of time before the IRS discovers your omission.</li>
<li>Claiming too many charitable contributions &#8211; Don&#8217;t report false donations. If you don&#8217;t have the proper documentation to prove the validity of your contribution, don&#8217;t claim it.</li>
<li>If you are self-employed &#8211; Business owners may attract additional review from the IRS. They tended to examine the returns of self-employed filers at higher rates than it did comparable non-business filers, according to IRS data. If you claim self-employment income and deductions through your individual income tax return, double-check your numbers and keep a paper trail to back up tax deductions.</li>
<li>Reporting too many losses on a Schedule C &#8211; This one is for the self-employed. If you are the boss, you might be inclined to hide income by taking personal expenses as business expenses. But before you do, consider the suspicion that too many reported losses could arouse.</li>
<li>Deducting too many business expenses &#8211; To be eligible as a deduction, purchases must be ordinary and necessary to your business.</li>
<li>Claiming a home office deduction &#8211; The IRS defines the home office deduction as reserved for people who use part of their home &#8220;exclusively and regularly for your trade or business.&#8221; That means a home office can qualify if you use it for work and work only.</li>
<li>Using round numbers &#8211; When making your calculations, be precise, and avoid making estimations. If the numbers all end in a double zero, it can look fishy.</li>
<li>Typos or math errors &#8211; It might be an honest mistake. Still, if something looks questionable, such as an incorrect Social Security number or calculations that don&#8217;t add up, you may bring on additional scrutiny from the IRS.</li>
<li>You have three consecutive years of business losses &#8211; For self-employed filers who have reported losses for three consecutive years, it does create a potential audit risk because the IRS will challenge that to see if it&#8217;s a business or it&#8217;s a hobby. A loss from a business is deductible; a hobby loss is not.</li>
<li>You deduct 100% of your car for business &#8211; When listing the business use of a work-related automobile, the IRS knows that it&#8217;s unlikely that you&#8217;re using it 100 percent for work. We recommend that clients use a mobile app to track mileage.</li>
<li>Mobile phone usage &#8211; unless you have a 2<sup>nd</sup> or 3<sup>rd</sup> mobile phone deducting 100% of the bill (which may include your spouse and children) will bring additional scrutiny.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="13">
<li>It doesn&#8217;t make sense &#8211; If you&#8217;re claiming large deductions on a small salary, you could find yourself required to provide additional documentation from the IRS.</li>
</ol>
<p>As long as you file taxes accurately and keep good records, you shouldn&#8217;t fear a tax audit. If you&#8217;re concerned about your tax return or the paperwork involved, meet with a competent tax preparer and make sure you keep accurate records throughout the year.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>G is for garnishment. Wage garnishment is one of the most common types of garnishment. The IRS can garnish or legally seize any income you make to satisfy federal tax debt or taxes owed.</p>
<h5>Garnishments can apply to your hourly wages, salary, commissions, and bonuses.</h5>
<p>When the IRS seeks to garnish your wages for a tax debt that you owe, it will first send you a written notice that sets out the amounts that you owe. The notice will include the tax, penalties, and interest. This notice should also provide you with a due date by which you must pay the balances in full. Assuming that you do not pay the balance in full, you later will receive another notice, entitled “Final Notice of Intent to Levy.” Once thirty days have passed from the time you have received the final notice, and you still have failed to pay the balance due, the IRS can proceed with garnishing your income.</p>
<p>The law places limits on the amount that a creditor can garnish from your wages. These normal limits do not apply to the IRS. The tax code requires the IRS to leave you with a certain amount of income after garnishing your wages to pay your tax debt. The tax code contains a table that corresponds to the number of exemptions that you claim for tax purposes. It tells the amount necessary for you and your family to pay for basic living necessities. Unfortunately, a garnishment by the IRS can amount to 70% or more of your income.</p>
<p>There are several different ways in which you can resolve your problem with the IRS. To stop a wage garnishment, you must get back into good standing with the IRS, either by paying your balance in full or entering into a tax payment plan or some other type of resolution.</p>

			<h4>F is for First Time Penalty Abatement</h4>
<ul>
<li>The first time penalty abatement (FTA) waiver is an administrative waiver that the IRS may grant to relieve taxpayers from failure-to-file, failure-to-pay and failure-to-deposit penalties if certain criteria are met.</li>
<li>The IRS also removes interest related to those penalties.</li>
</ul>
<p>First Time Penalty Abatement is an option that may be available to taxpayers to remove IRS penalties that have been assessed to a tax debt. However, not everyone qualifies for penalty abatement. Also, not all penalties are eligible for penalty abatement. Some of the most common penalties that are able to be abated are failure to file, failure to pay, and failure to deposit estimated tax.</p>
<h5>You may qualify for administrative relief from penalties for failing to file a tax return, pay on time, and/or to deposit taxes when due under the IRS First Time Penalty Abatement policy if you meet the following:</h5>
<ul>
<li>A taxpayer didn’t previously have to file a return, or you have no penalties for the 3 tax years prior to the tax year in which you received a penalty.</li>
<li>You filed all currently required returns or filed an extension of time to file.</li>
<li>You have paid, or arranged to pay, any tax due.</li>
</ul>
<p>The failure-to-pay penalty will continue to accrue, until the tax is paid in full. It may be to your advantage to wait until you fully pay the tax due prior to requesting penalty relief under the Service&#8217;s first-time penalty abatement policy. The penalty is 5% of your balance per month.</p>
<p>Interest charged on a penalty will be reduced or removed when that penalty is reduced or removed. If an unpaid balance remains on your account, interest will continue to accrue until the account is full paid.</p>
<p>Other administrative relief: If you received incorrect oral advice from the IRS, you may qualify for administrative relief.</p>
<p>Determining whether a situation or event qualifies a taxpayer for penalty relief can be tricky. Seeking professional help from an Enrolled Agent and Certified Tax Resolution Specialist is helpful not only because the tax professional is familiar with the qualifications for penalty abatement, but also, they will know how to properly organize and submit your request.  Discover how to solve your tax problem by speaking with us today. <a href="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/media/"> Find out more about me</a>.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Tax Resolution Alphabet -E is for (Tax) Evasion. Tax evasion occurs when a person or business illegally avoids paying their tax liability, which is a criminal charge that’s subject to penalties and fines.</p>
<h4><strong>Overview:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Tax evasion can be either the illegal non-payment or underpayment of actual tax liabilities due.</li>
<li>Tax evasion can be determined by the IRS regardless of whether or not tax forms were filed with the agency.</li>
<li>To determine tax evasion, the agency must be able to show that the avoidance of taxes was willful on the part of the taxpayer.</li>
<li>While tax evasion is illegal, tax avoidance includes finding legal ways (within the law) to reduce taxpayer obligations.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is tax evasion?</strong></h4>
<p>Tax evasion is an illegal activity in which a person or entity deliberately avoids paying a tax liability. Individuals caught evading taxes are usually subject to criminal charges and substantial penalties. To willfully fail to pay taxes is a federal offense under the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax code.</p>
<p>In order for charges to be levied, it must be determined that the avoidance of taxes was a willful act on the part of the taxpayer. Not only can a person be liable for payment of any taxes that have been left unpaid, but they can also be found guilty of criminal and civil charges and may be required to serve jail time. According to the IRS, the penalties include jail time of no more than five years, a fine of no more than $250,000 for individuals or $500,000 for corporations, or both—along with the costs of prosecution.</p>
<p>When determining if the act of failure to pay was intentional, a variety of factors are considered. Most commonly, a taxpayer’s financial situation will be examined in an effort to confirm if the nonpayment was the result of committing fraud or of the concealment of reportable income. Unlike in an audit where the burden of proof falls to the taxpayer, in a criminal situation the IRS/Department of Justice bears the burden.<img class="alignright  wp-image-4321" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/CID-shield-handcuffs-1040-form-300x158.png" alt="CID shield-handcuffs-1040 form" width="384" height="202" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/CID-shield-handcuffs-1040-form-300x158.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/CID-shield-handcuffs-1040-form-768x404.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/CID-shield-handcuffs-1040-form.png 1000w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/CID-shield-handcuffs-1040-form-700x368.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 384px) 100vw, 384px" /></p>
<h5><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_evasion_in_the_United_States">E is for (Tax) Evasion </a></h5>
<p>A failure to pay may be judged fraudulent in cases where a taxpayer made efforts to conceal assets by associating them with a person other than themselves. This can include reporting income under a false name and Social Security number (SSN), which can also constitute identity theft. A person may be judged as concealing income for failure to report work that did not follow traditional payment recording methods. This can include acceptance of a cash payment for goods or services rendered without reporting them properly to the IRS during a tax filing.</p>
<p>In most cases of<a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-utl/tax_crimes_handbook.pdf"> corporate tax evasion listed on the IRS website</a>, the tax liability was underrepresented. Many business owners undervalued the sums of their receipts to the agency, an act which was deemed to be the purposeful evasion of tax. These were documented to be sources of income, revenue, and profits that were not accurately reported.</p>
<p>Don’t let the burden of failure to file and owing <a href="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/the-tax-resolution-alphabet-b-is-for-back-taxes/">back taxes</a> hang over your head any longer.

			<h4><strong>The Tax Resolution Alphabet &#8211; D is for Debt Relief</strong></h4>
<p>If you are struggling with IRS tax debt and feel like it’s a hopeless situation, it may not be as  awful as you think. The IRS Fresh Start Program was created to make it easier and more accessible for people to repay or settle their tax debt.</p>
<p>Taxes often seem overwhelming and overly complex, almost like a project that you didn’t research and were unable to complete.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Fresh Start Program</strong></h5>
<p>The IRS initiated its Fresh Start Program in 2008 and expanded it in 2012 to ease the financial burdens of taxpayers who owe up to $50,000 in taxes. It is available to both business owners and individual taxpayers</p>
<p>The program is designed to allow taxpayers to pay off substantial tax debts affordably over the course of six years. Each month, taxpayers make payments that are based on their current income and the value of their liquid assets.</p>
<p>It simplifies the process of paying back large tax debts. It also helps people avoid many of the damages of owing a tax debt to the IRS including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accrued Interest</li>
<li>Recurring Penalties</li>
<li>Tax liens</li>
<li>Seizure of assets</li>
<li>Wage garnishments</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong> Qualifies for the Fresh Start Program?</strong></h5>
<p>In order to qualify for the IRS Fresh Start Program for debt settlement or lien withdrawals, generally you&#8217;ll need a couple of things at a minimum:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any missing or unfiled tax returns must be filed.</li>
<li>You are current with your estimated tax payments or your current withholdings are correct, and they have been so for the last 6 months.</li>
</ul>

			<p style="text-align: left;">C is for the <em>Currently Not Collectible</em><em> </em><em>Status </em>from the IRS</p>
<p>Big companies are known for getting all sorts of breaks, but when average people fall behind, they rarely receive help. When you owe back taxes, but can’t afford to pay them, then you may qualify for a special tax status known as <em>currently not collectible</em>.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-4118 alignleft" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/C-is-for-currently-not-collectible-300x158.png" alt="" width="391" height="206" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/C-is-for-currently-not-collectible-300x158.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/C-is-for-currently-not-collectible-768x404.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/C-is-for-currently-not-collectible.png 1000w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/C-is-for-currently-not-collectible-700x368.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 391px) 100vw, 391px" /></p>
<p>If you’re IRS approved for currently not collectible status, they must not only cease its collection efforts, but they can no longer garnish your wages or seize your property.</p>
<p>Want to know if you qualify for currently not collectible status? Contact our firm here for a specific evaluation of your situation. <em>Visit our website, <a href="http://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/">sfstaxproblemsolutions.com</a> to book your <strong>Free Debt Settlement Analysis</strong> at </em><a href="https://go.oncehub.com/jeffreyschneider"><strong>https://go.oncehub.com/jeffreyschneider</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>What is Currently Not Collectible Status? </strong></p>
<p>If the IRS agrees that you can’t pay your back taxes and cover your reasonable living expenses, they may place your account in the Currently Not Collectible status.  This determination is based on your <img class="alignright wp-image-4111" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-300x300.png" alt="warning sign, do not try this alone" width="269" height="269" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-300x300.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-150x150.png 150w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-768x768.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-570x570.png 570w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-500x500.png 500w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-1000x1000.png 1000w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-700x700.png 700w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 269px) 100vw, 269px" />current financial situation.</p>
<p>You can request currently not collectible status by submitting the proper form and proof to the IRS of your income and expenses, as well as whether you can sell any assets you may have or get a loan.</p>
<p>As you’ll need to be able to document your inability to pay, be sure to gather copies of all your bills, your most recent paycheck stubs, and statements detailing other sources of income such as alimony, pensions or investments. If the IRS determines that your necessary expenses exceed your income, then it will notify you of your Currently Not Collectable status.</p>
<p>WARNING: Don’t try to do this alone. We recommend reaching out to our tax resolution firm to guide you through your options. Talking to the IRS directly could be like shooting yourself in the foot. They’ll ask you very invasive questions that could land you in deeper trouble. Remember, the IRS is not your friend. Their job is to collect what they believe you owe them, so it’s best to have a professional in your corner.</p>
<p><strong>Not a Permanent Solution</strong></p>
<p>Keep in mind that currently not collectible status applies only to your back taxes. You will still have to file tax returns, and you will not be exempted from paying current and future taxes. You will also continue to accumulate penalties and interest on your unpaid taxes. After a year or two, the IRS may review your status, and if you’re able to begin paying your back taxes, then you must do so. If you’re still not able to pay, then your status will be renewed.</p>
<p><strong>Statute of Limitations   </strong></p>
<p>The IRS can attempt to collect outstanding taxes for only ten years from the date the taxes were assessed against you; usually, that’s the date you filed. If at the end of this 10-year period the IRS hasn’t collected, then the taxes are no longer owed.</p>
<p>In difficult times, many families have trouble meeting their commitments. If you’re worried about the IRS garnishing your wages, levying your bank account, or taking your home, then reaching out to our firm and getting a free, no-obligation, confidential consultation on your tax problem may give you some peace of mind.

			<p><strong>Owe Money to the IRS? It&#8217;s Called Back Taxes</strong></p>
<p>Back taxes refer to taxes owed from a prior year.</p>
<p>A taxpayer may be behind in paying taxes for intentional or negligent reasons. Some of these reasons include – filing a return and failing to pay the tax liability; failing to report all income earned during the tax year, and; neglecting to file a tax return for a given tax year.</p>

<p>If taxes remain unpaid after multiple notices have been sent by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), a minimum penalty fee of $135 will be charged in addition to interest on the unpaid amount, which is 0.5% per month that the taxpayer is late, up to 25%. As the total tax debt increases each month due to penalty and interest, over time, it can grow into a significant amount.</p>

<p>Unpaid back taxes can be a serious issue for many taxpayers who don&#8217;t have the means to pay them. Depending upon the circumstances, the government may take one of many strategies to deal with back taxes, such as pressing charges, demanding that that the taxpayer pay immediately, or sometimes offering a voluntary disclosure program which helps avoid criminal charges and allows a variety of payment options. Failure to pay taxes can also involve imprisonment.</p>
<p>In some cases, the IRS will seize property, seize assets, or place liens on property. The IRS may place a federal tax lien to inform other creditors of the taxing authorities legal right to a taxpayer’s assets and property. The IRS also has the power to garnish a taxpayer’s wages and to levy their financial accounts, seizing up to the total amount of taxes owed. If the taxes remain unpaid, the tax authority can use a tax levy to legally seize the taxpayer&#8217;s assets (such as bank accounts, investment accounts, automobiles, and real property) in order to collect the money, it is owed. While a lien secures the government’s interest or claim in an individual’s or business’ property when the tax debt remains unpaid, a levy actually permits the government to seize and sell the property in order to pay the tax debt.</p>

			<p>IRS Appeals</p>
<p>An unexpected envelope from the Internal Revenue Service is never a good thing.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s never pleasant, but any letter that you receive should not be ignored, especially if you disagree with an IRS decision.</p>
<p>In fact, the IRS Taxpayer Bill of Rights covers this specific situation as one of a taxpayer&#8217;s rights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay no more than the correct amount of tax,</li>
<li>Challenge the IRS&#8217; position and be heard and</li>
<li>Appeal an IRS decision in an independent forum</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some tips on getting through an IRS disagreement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get professional help: First, if you don&#8217;t have a tax professional, get one.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if your disputed tax situation is not that complicated, dealing with the IRS can be difficult. A tax professional that has standing with the IRS, like an Enrolled Agent (EA), CPA, or attorney with experience in resolving issues between the IRS and taxpayers can save you time, and money. A Certified Tax Resolution Specialist (CTRS) is specially trained to argue your case before the IRS.</p>
<ul>
<li>Know the general appeals process: Your tax pro will help you understand what to expect and what happens during your appeal process.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Appeals Office is separate from and independent of the IRS office that took action against you. It&#8217;s also the only level of administrative appeal within the IRS.</p>
<p>Conferences with an Appeals Office representative can be held informally by correspondence, telephone, or at a face-to-face meeting.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to have official representation at an appeals conference, but as noted at the beginning of this post, it&#8217;s generally a good idea.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4156" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IRS-letter-300x251.png" alt="IRS letter-sfs tax problem solutions" width="300" height="251" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IRS-letter-300x251.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IRS-letter-768x644.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IRS-letter-700x587.png 700w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IRS-letter.png 940w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Preparation is essential: If you do go to the Appeals Office, be prepared to discuss all issues you don&#8217;t agree with at the conference.</p>
<p>You also might need to file a formal written protest or a small case request with the office named in the IRS letter you received.</p>
<p>And definitely be sure to file your protest within the time limit specified in the letter you received.</p>
<p>Specifically, Appeals isn&#8217;t interested in and won&#8217;t accept any objection you have based on moral, religious, political, constitutional, conscientious, or similar grounds.</p>
<ul>
<li>Let the pros handle it: Your tax adviser can file the written protest for you.</li>
</ul>
<p>He or she also can take care of the discussions or hearings without you if you decide you just don&#8217;t want to go it alone.</p>
<p>If you do opt to skip the Appeal Office meeting and send only your lawyer, CPA or EA to make your case, be sure you have completed a power of attorney form allowing your representative to receive and inspect confidential information.</p>
<ul>
<li>Beyond Appeals: The IRS says that going through the Office of Appeals process generally settles most tax disputes without expensive and time-consuming court trials.</li>
</ul>
<p>If, however, that&#8217;s not the case in your tax disagreement, you can take your protest to the judicial level. This includes appeals to the United States Tax Court, the United States Court of Federal Claims or your United States District Court.</p>
<p>In difficult times, many families have trouble meeting their commitments. If you’re worried about the IRS garnishing your wages, levying your bank account, or taking your home,</p>
