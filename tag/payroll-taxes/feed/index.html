<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Attorney and GOP Power Broker Has Champagne Taste but Claims a Beer Budget</strong></h1>
<p>George Gilmore, one of the most powerful figures for the GOP in New Jersey, was indicted in Jan. 2019 on six federal tax-related counts.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-3651 " src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Attorney-and-GOP-Power-Broker-Has-Champagne-Taste-but-Claims-a-Beer-Budget-man-counting-money-desk-smartphones-1.jpg" alt="" width="527" height="392" /></p>
<p>Gilmore, an attorney at the firm Gilmore &amp; Monahan, which had $2 million in public contracts across the state in 2017, was charged with tax evasion, filing false tax returns, failing to collect, account for and pay payroll taxes, and making false statements on a bank loan application. Gilmore is also chairman of the Orange County GOP and the county Board of Elections.</p>
<p>According to the indictment, while Gilmore owed the IRS more than $1.5 million in taxes, penalties and interest, rather than paying that debt he spent more than $2.5 million on personal expenses.  Also, between January 2014 and December 2016, Gilmore spent $380,000 to remodel his waterfront home in Toms River, including an infinity pool and cabana; $440,000 on antiques, artwork and collectables including animal tusks; $20,000 on a Steinway piano and $80,000 on model trains. In order to hide the personal expenses, Gilmore classified the payments as “shareholder loans.”  He did send one check to the IRS for $500,000 but that check bounced as there was less than $2,500 in the account.</p>
<p>Kevin Marino, Gilmore’s attorney said, “George Gilmore faithfully reported every penny of his income, and repeatedly expressed his intention to pay his taxes together with interest and penalties, freely conceded that he was unable to do so in a timely fashion, and share with the government the reasons why, and disclosed that he suffers from “hoarding disorder.”</p>
<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>Gilmore could face a potential decades-long prison sentence and fines between $250,000 and $1 million.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Being late on your income tax is one thing. Payroll taxes are an entirely different story, however.</p>
<p>Although I may not want to hear it, I’ve had so many new clients tell me they haven’t filed income tax returns for years and have finally decided it’s time to get right with the IRS.</p>
<p>Which is commendable… the “getting right” part.</p>
<p>Not paying your taxes for years? I don’t recommend that. First, you can get caught at any time, and, second, interest and penalties will continue racking up as time goes on).</p>
<p>But I digress…</p>
<h3><strong>What’s up with Payroll Taxes? </strong></h3>
<p>The IRS takes the payment of payroll tax very, very seriously.</p>
<p>You can tell by their penalty system… penalties for failure to file, failure to deposit and failure to pay are assessed per <em>occurrence</em>. That means each time you didn’t file or pay for <em>each employee. </em></p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-1449 alignright" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Attention-Business-Owners-Payroll-Taxes-Can-Trip-You-Up-in-a-Hurry-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-closed-sign-business-shut-down-300x199.png" alt="Attention Business Owners, Payroll Taxes Can Trip You Up in a Hurry, SFS Tax Problem Solutions, closed sign, business shut down" width="300" height="199" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Attention-Business-Owners-Payroll-Taxes-Can-Trip-You-Up-in-a-Hurry-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-closed-sign-business-shut-down-300x199.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Attention-Business-Owners-Payroll-Taxes-Can-Trip-You-Up-in-a-Hurry-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-closed-sign-business-shut-down-768x510.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Attention-Business-Owners-Payroll-Taxes-Can-Trip-You-Up-in-a-Hurry-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-closed-sign-business-shut-down-700x465.png 700w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Attention-Business-Owners-Payroll-Taxes-Can-Trip-You-Up-in-a-Hurry-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-closed-sign-business-shut-down.png 784w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>The IRS has no qualms about shutting you down for not paying payroll taxes.</p>
<p>If you are wondering why this is, ask yourself if it could be because you are messing with your employee’s tax situation? That you are entrusted with a sacred duty to withhold those taxes and pay them on time? That it is actually the employee’s money that you are holding in trust?</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely… to all three.</p>
<p>Think of it this way: You are withholding taxes from your employees’ wages, so it’s money that they owe the government. When you don’t do your duty to pass them along, you are basically stealing it.</p>
<p>The important thing is to know is that they will come down on you swiftly and hard.</p>

<h3><strong>What Can the IRS do if I Don’t Pay Payroll Taxes? </strong></h3>
<p>They can also shut down your business in the blink of an eye… and they don’t need a court order to do so.</p>
<p>As a business owner, you, and even your officers, can be held personally responsible for unpaid payroll taxes.</p>
<p>If you willfully don’t file or pay those payroll taxes, you could wind up guilty of a federal crime.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor – if you need money to run your business, don’t look at payroll taxes a free, short-term loan. That’s not what it is there for, not to mention the business-ending, life-altering consequences that come along with mishandling those funds.</p>
