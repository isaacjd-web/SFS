<p>Snipes continues to getting knocked down by the IRS. Rather than give up, he too keeps getting back in the ring. In his latest skirmish with the service, the Tax Court held that the IRS did not abuse its discretion by refusing to accept his offer in compromise.</p>
<p>Snipes’ problems began with federal tax liabilities of $23.5 million from 2001-2006. This was partially a result of his failure to file tax returns. The IRS assessed those liabilities, and filed a notice of federal tax lien. It then issued a notice and demand for payment of the liabilities.</p>

<p>Wesley Snipes must know a little how Carmen Basilio felt.</p>
<p>Basilio, the “Upstate Onion Farmer” from Canastota, N.Y., was a world champion boxer in both the Welterweight and Middleweight divisions during the 1950s. Unfortunately, he was knocked down repeatedly in one match that he was sure to lose. When asked afterward why he kept getting up despite having no chance, he reportedly said “I don’t want to start any bad habits.”</p>
<p>Snipes continues to getting knocked down by the IRS. Rather than give up, he too keeps getting back in the ring. In his latest skirmish with the service, the Tax Court held that the IRS did not abuse its discretion by refusing to accept his offer in compromise.</p>
<p>Snipes’ problems began with federal tax liabilities of $23.5 million from 2001-2006. This was partially a result of his failure to file tax returns. The IRS assessed those liabilities, and filed a notice of federal tax lien. It then issued a notice and demand for payment of the liabilities. <img class="alignright wp-image-2540" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Wesley-Snipes-Continuously-Fights-the-IRS-carmen-basilio-fighting-getting-medical-assistance.jpg" alt="Wesley Snipes Continuously Fights the IRS, carmen, basilio, fighting, getting medical assistance" width="485" height="281" /></p>
<h3><strong>The Proceedings</strong></h3>
<p>When Snipes did not pay, the IRS issued a notice of the filing. Snipes requested a collection due process hearing and stated that he wanted a collection alternative – an offer in compromise or “currently not collectible” status – and wanted the notice of federal tax lien withdrawn.</p>
<p>Snipes did not challenge his underlying tax liabilities. He made a cash offer of $842,061, less than 4 percent of the total underlying liability. The IRS issued a notice of determination rejecting his OIC and sustaining the notice of federal tax lien. Snipes filed a petition with the Tax Court.</p>
<p>Snipes contended during both CDP proceedings that his financial adviser, W. Johnson, had taken out loans and disposed of assets and income on his behalf, diverting the funds without his knowledge or benefit. He provided affidavits from Johnson of his misconduct and misuse of his assets and income, but did not provide any definitive documentation showing the dissipation or diversion of his assets or income.</p>
<p>Snipes requested that the IRS conduct a transferee investigation of Johnson, and that they accept his offer with the condition of proving Johnson’s transferee liability. The settlement officer requested permission from her manager to conduct an expedited transferee investigation, but the manager explained that the CDP hearing could not be held open for a transferee investigation, nor could the IRS accept an OIC with conditions imposed on it.</p>
<h3><strong>One of Many Verdicts</strong></h3>
<p>Following a review of Snipe’s case, the settlement officer an effort to compromise for settlement purposes. She reduced Snipes’ “reasonable collection potential” to $9,581,027. Snipes maintained his original OIC of $842,061. The settlement officer concluded that it was not in the best interest of the government to accept the OIC. She issued Snipes a supplemental notice sustaining the notice of federal tax lien, and again rejecting Snipes’ OIC.</p>
<p>The Tax Court noted that the validity of Snipes’ underlying tax liabilities was not at issue. The court concluded that the settlement officer properly based her determination on the required factors. They determined that she did not abuse her discretion in determining that acceptance of the OIC was not in the best interests of the United States.</p>
<p>The Tax Court held that in light of Snipes’ failure to provide bona fide documentation to prove his assets and financial condition, as well as the disparity in his offer versus his RCP as determined by the IRS, the settlement officer did not abuse her discretion in her rejection of Snipes’ offer, refusing to conduct an expedited transferee investigation, or sustaining the filing of the notice. <img class="alignright wp-image-2541" title="Wesley Snipes Continuously Fights the IRS, on tv" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Wesley-Snipes-Continuously-Fights-the-IRS-on-tv.jpg" alt="Wesley Snipes Continuously Fights the IRS, on tv" width="564" height="411" /></p>
<p>“The court was unable to determine whether or not he still owned the property. On a smaller scale, this is what happens all the time,” Davidoff noted. “And it’s not the end of the line for him.</p>
<h3><strong>What Happens Next: The Cycle</strong></h3>
<p>Now it will go back to Collections, and start all over again. In the meantime he has delayed the IRS, and the statute of limitations has been extended for five years. My guess is that he’s paid more than $100,000 to do this, but he has all the rights that any other taxpayer has in Collections. If they think some of his assets got transferred to Johnson, they might try to seize some of those assets.”</p>
<p>“It sounds like he has a lot of illiquid assets or assets that he can’t account for. If he’s correct in the valuation of his assets, then that’s all they can take – they can’t take more than he has,” Davidoff mentioned.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Oh No! The IRS Sent a Tax Notice</h2>
<p>The moment you take an IRS Notice from your mailbox, it&#8217;s time to open it and call an enrolled agent immediately. A tax professional will be able to guide you through the process of resolving your tax problem and place you in the best possible light in front of the IRS.</p>
<h2><strong>The Scary Stuff</strong></h2>
<p>If you don’t take action now, the IRS &#8211; which is the world’s largest and most aggressive collection agency &#8211; could cause incredible hardships down the road. You can&#8217;t bury your head in the sand once you receive the notice. Have you heard of tax liens and tax levies? The IRS uses these two methods to collect their dues. Taxpayers must fix their problems quickly and voluntarily.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Tax Liens</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">A tax lien is a claim on your property. If your tax debt exceeds $10,000, the IRS issues a &#8220;secret – or silent &#8211; lien&#8221; because even though at first there is no public record, it attaches to all of your property and rights to property — both real estate and personal property — as of the date the tax is assessed.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For example, a tax is assessed against you on July 1st and you give the property to a third party as a gift on July 2nd. The tax lien continues to be attached to that property, even though you had no prior knowledge of the existence of the tax lien. The person who received the property didn&#8217;t know that the tax lien had arisen!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wp-image-1841 alignleft" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/What-to-do-when-the-IRS-sends-a-tax-notice-bank-conference-crisis-financial-debt.jpg" alt="" width="366" height="227" />When most taxpayers or tax professionals refer to a tax lien, they are actually referring to a &#8220;Notice of Federal Tax Lien&#8221; (NFTL). An NFTL is a document filed in a public place, such as a county recorder&#8217;s office or with the Secretary of State. It is a notice to the world that you owe taxes. A Notice of Federal Tax Lien lists the amount of the taxes owed, the type of tax, and even the years for which taxes are owed.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Notice of Federal Tax Lien may even be picked up by the various credit reporting agencies, and may cause significant credit problems. At this point, don&#8217;t sell any property you own. Your property equity will go directly to the IRS.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Tax Levies</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">A levy is the IRS collecting a debt you owe through the seizure of your property; be it cash (bank) or wages (garnishment). A tax levy is not available for the general public to see. It also does not affect your credit rating by itself or prevent you from selling your property. However, if the IRS serves a tax levy on your bank, the bank is <strong>required</strong> to send all your money to the IRS up to the amount of the tax debt. The bank will then notify you of its receipt of the tax levy. After that, you&#8217;ll have 21 calendar days to negotiate with the IRS to try and convince them to release it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If the IRS sends a tax levy to your employer, your employer is required to send the required amount to the IRS and because there is no 21-day holding period, the tax levy is effective starting with the very first paycheck you receive after the employer receives the tax levy. In addition, there is no holding period. If you find out the IRS has served a tax levy on your employer, it is extremely important to contact a qualified enrolled agent. He or she will begin immediate negotiations with your employer before your next paycheck. Your bank and your employer will forward your money to the IRS. Once that happens, it is very hard to get them back.</p>
<h5><em>An Impeding Feeling of Doom</em></h5>
<p>The IRS can seize assets such as wages, bank accounts, social security benefits, and retirement income. The IRS may also seize and sell your property to satisfy the tax debt. This includes your car, boat, real estate, etc. <em>Ouch.</em> In addition, any future federal tax refunds will be used to pay off the debt. Even state income tax refunds that you&#8217;re due may be seized and applied to your federal tax liability.<br />
If the IRS sent a tax notice, it’s absolutely crucial that you get help from an enrolled agent. He or she will help you move forward and prevent the IRS from creating such hardships.</p>
<h2><strong>A Fresh Start for All</strong><img class="wp-image-1842 alignright" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/What-to-do-when-the-IRS-sends-a-tax-notice-girl-jumping-fence-happy.jpg" alt="" width="386" height="233" /></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/new-irs-fresh-start-initiative-helps-taxpayers-who-owe-taxes">IRS Fresh Start program</a> makes it easier for taxpayers and even small businesses to pay back taxes and avoid tax liens. If the IRS sent a tax notice, you should know the features of and consider the Fresh Start program:</p>
<h5>• <strong>Tax Liens</strong></h5>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Fresh Start program increased the amount that taxpayers can owe to $10,000. The IRS generally will file a Notice of Federal Tax Lien once the taxpayer surpasses that. However, in some cases, the IRS may still file a lien notice on amounts less than $10,000.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Some taxpayers may qualify to have their lien notice withdrawn if they are paying their tax debt through a Direct Debit Installment Agreement. However, if a taxpayer defaults on the Direct Debit Installment Agreement, the IRS may file a new Notice of Federal Tax Lien and resume collection actions.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A taxpayer must meet certain requirements and pays off their tax debt. After that, the IRS may withdraw the Notice of Federal Tax Lien. Taxpayers must request this in writing, and we can help with this.</p>
<h5><strong>• Installment Agreements.</strong></h5>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Fresh Start program expanded access to streamlined installment agreements. Now, individual taxpayers who owe up to $50,000 can pay monthly direct debit payments for up to six years. They are also able to pay up to when the collection statutes expire &#8211; 10 years from the date the tax was assessed. While the IRS generally will not need a financial statement, they may need some financial information from the taxpayer. Your enrolled agent can collect and submit this for you.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Taxpayers in need of installment agreements for tax debts more than $50,000 or longer than six years still need to provide the IRS with a financial statement.</p>
<h5><strong>• Offers in Compromise.<img class=" wp-image-1843 alignright" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/What-to-do-when-the-IRS-sends-a-tax-notice-an-offer-in-compromise-dad-and-son-walking.jpg" alt="" width="260" height="254" /></strong></h5>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">An Offer in Compromise (OIC) allows taxpayers to settle their tax debt for less than the full amount. Fresh Start expanded and streamlined the OIC program. If approved, the IRS accepts a lesser amount – sometimes even just a fraction of what’s owed – to settle your debt. It isn’t always easy to gain approval (less than 40% was accepted in 2016). The IRS considers your income, assets, expenses, ability to pay, and potential hardship. However, the IRS now has more flexibility when analyzing a taxpayer’s ability to pay. This makes the offer program available to a larger group of taxpayers.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Generally, the IRS will accept an offer if it&#8217;s the most the agency can expect to collect within a reasonable period of time. The IRS will not accept an offer if the taxpayer can pay the amount owed in full.</p>
<h2><strong>Avoiding a Lien</strong></h2>
<p>You can avoid a federal tax lien by simply filing and paying all your taxes in full and on time. If you can’t file or pay on time, don’t ignore the letters or correspondence you get from the IRS. If the IRS sent a tax notice, Jeffrey Schneider, EA, CTRS is ready to help provide payment options that are available to help you settle your tax debt over time.</p>
