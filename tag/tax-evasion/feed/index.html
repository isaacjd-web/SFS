<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Massachusetts Couple Could Face Long Prison Term</strong></h1>
<p>Gary DeCicco and Pamela Avedisian of Nahant, MA, were charged with multiple felonies. We&#8217;re talking two counts of tax evasion, one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud. They&#8217;ve also been charged with four counts of wire fraud and six counts of engaging in unlawful monetary transactions.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-3647 " src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Massachusetts-Couple-Could-Face-Long-Prison-Term-hands-handcuffs-white-wall-1.jpg" alt="" width="590" height="385" /></p>
<p>Between April 2012 and February 2013, DeCicco told the IRS that he did not have the ability to pay his more than $340,000 tax liability.  He repeatedly claimed he had very little cash, no vehicles or real properties during that time.</p>
<p>According to the IRS, he had ownership of several businesses, vehicles and real estate, titled to other entities to conceal his ownership from the IRS.</p>
<p>Originally, the IRS accepted a monthly installment plan based on false information.  During that time, DeCicco allegedly bought and sold numerous real properties, boats, luxury cars, concealing the sales with the help of Avedisian.</p>
<h2><strong>The Results of Their Fraud</strong></h2>
<p>The couple could face up to 5 years in prison for each count of tax evasion, up to 30 years for wire fraud and conspiracy to commit bank fraud, and up to 20 years for unlawful monetary transactions consecutively, as well as supervised release and monetary fines and penalties.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Attorney and GOP Power Broker Has Champagne Taste but Claims a Beer Budget</strong></h1>
<p>George Gilmore, one of the most powerful figures for the GOP in New Jersey, was indicted in Jan. 2019 on six federal tax-related counts.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-3651 " src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Attorney-and-GOP-Power-Broker-Has-Champagne-Taste-but-Claims-a-Beer-Budget-man-counting-money-desk-smartphones-1.jpg" alt="" width="527" height="392" /></p>
<p>Gilmore, an attorney at the firm Gilmore &amp; Monahan, which had $2 million in public contracts across the state in 2017, was charged with tax evasion, filing false tax returns, failing to collect, account for and pay payroll taxes, and making false statements on a bank loan application. Gilmore is also chairman of the Orange County GOP and the county Board of Elections.</p>
<p>According to the indictment, while Gilmore owed the IRS more than $1.5 million in taxes, penalties and interest, rather than paying that debt he spent more than $2.5 million on personal expenses.  Also, between January 2014 and December 2016, Gilmore spent $380,000 to remodel his waterfront home in Toms River, including an infinity pool and cabana; $440,000 on antiques, artwork and collectables including animal tusks; $20,000 on a Steinway piano and $80,000 on model trains. In order to hide the personal expenses, Gilmore classified the payments as “shareholder loans.”  He did send one check to the IRS for $500,000 but that check bounced as there was less than $2,500 in the account.</p>
<p>Kevin Marino, Gilmore’s attorney said, “George Gilmore faithfully reported every penny of his income, and repeatedly expressed his intention to pay his taxes together with interest and penalties, freely conceded that he was unable to do so in a timely fashion, and share with the government the reasons why, and disclosed that he suffers from “hoarding disorder.”</p>
<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>Gilmore could face a potential decades-long prison sentence and fines between $250,000 and $1 million.</p>

<p>Gucci doesn’t seem to be doing so well lately. One of the most world-renowned Italian fashion brands has been dealing with some pretty heavy stuff, from the Blackface Jumper to their back taxes crisis.</p>
<h2><strong>A Major Fashion Mistake </strong></h2>
<p>Gucci had to pull a controversial jumper from its stores and website after becoming embroiled in a blackface racism row. An image of its women’s “balaclava jumper” received tons of backlash after being shared on social media. It was a black top that features neck with a mouth cut-out outlined in red.</p>
<p>Gucci has since issued an apology “for the offense caused” and has removed the item from its stores and online.</p>
<p>However, the £688 jumper is still available for purchase on the shopping website Spring. It is captioned as being part of the “The Fall Winter 2018 runway show” and was “inspired by vintage ski masks”.</p>
<h2><strong>Back Taxes Crisis</strong></h2>
<p>If that isn’t enough to deal with, Kering SA, the French owner of the Gucci luxury brand received a government audit. As it turns out, Gucci owes $1.6 billion ($1.4 Euros) to Italy in back taxes. Both Gucci’s chief executive Marco Bizzarri and former chief executive Patrizio Di Marco are under investigation currently.</p>
<p>The probe scrutinized business activities by Kering’s Swiss subsidiary, Luxury Goods International, from 2011 through 2017, according to a company statement. Kering said it contests the findings of the Italian audit. <img class="alignright wp-image-3680 " src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Gucci-Brand-in-Crisis-Mode-with-Back-Taxes-and-Racist-Mistake-1.jpg" alt="Gucci Brand in Crisis Mode with Back Taxes and Racist Mistake, gucci store, store, italy" width="435" height="380" /></p>
<p>While the initial liability is in the expected range and “should not shock,” the company might face additional fines, John Guy, an analyst with Mainfirst Bank, said in a note. The company “has been provisioning ahead for the liability and will be able to offset part of the claim, hence we expect a lower net number.”</p>
<p>The auditor’s report will be reviewed by Italy’s revenue agency. Then a final conclusion will be made, according to the statement. Kering said it doesn’t have the necessary information to make a specific accounting provision for the tax exposure. It has implemented strict monitoring of its tax risks.</p>
<p>French news site Mediapart had reported that the company billed for business carried out in other countries at a Swiss logistics center. As a result, it paid lower tax rates than it would have in Italy.</p>
