			<p>There have been a lot of stories about surprised taxpayers this year, and many of those surprises were decidedly unpleasant. Taxpayers who had received large refunds for years were shocked to find that they owed the IRS money this year, sometimes thousands of dollars in additional taxes due. Let&#8217;s face it, nobody likes a surprise tax bill.</p>
<h3><strong><img class="alignright wp-image-3869" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Steps-to-Take-if-You-Received-a-Surprise-Tax-Bill-mailbox-surprise-mail.jpg" alt="" width="613" height="533" /></strong></h3>
<p>Still others were shocked to find an IRS notice in their mailboxes &#8211; a formal letter detailing an additional tax liability and demanding payment for taxes due. These IRS notices can leave even the most conscientious tax filer blindsided &#8211; and wondering what to do next.</p>
<p>Whether you expected a refund and received a bill or found a notice from the IRS lurking in your mailbox, what you do next matters a great deal. Here are some critical steps to take if you owe money to the IRS.</p>
<h3><strong>Stop Panicking</strong></h3>
<p>There is no scarier piece of mail than a notice from the IRS, especially if that notice comes with a big tax bill attached. Even so, a notification of additional taxes due is no excuse to panic, and worrying will not make the problem go away.</p>
<p>So calm down, think rationally and plan your next steps carefully. There are right and wrong ways to address the issue, and the steps you take next could make all the difference.</p>
<h3><strong>Double-Check Your Math and Gather Your Documents</strong></h3>
<p>Something as simple as a transposed number or mismatched form could trigger a notice from the IRS, but the good news is these problems can be easy to resolve. Before you do anything else, go back to your original documents and double-check your numbers.</p>
<p>Compare the 1099 forms and W2s you received with the numbers you entered on your return. If there are inconsistencies and errors, you may be able to simply file an amended return and resolve the issue.</p>
<h3><strong>Contact a Tax Resolution Firm</strong></h3>
<p>Your tax preparer can be a big help when you receive an audit notice or demand for additional taxes from the IRS, but chances are they won’t know how to negotiate with the IRS nor will they fully understand your options for tax relief.</p>
<p>Working with a firm that specializes in tax debt relief and tax resolution, you’ll be able to map out a plan to get your back taxes taken care of.</p>
<h3><strong>Ask About Possible Penalty Forgiveness <img class="alignright wp-image-3870" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Steps-to-Take-if-You-Received-a-Surprise-Tax-Bill-administration-adult-girl-reading-papers.jpg" alt="" width="533" height="528" /></strong></h3>
<p>Changes to the tax code have left many taxpayers owing money to the IRS when they expected to be cashing big refund checks. The limitations in the deductibility of state and local taxes, coupled with updates to the withholding tables, have left millions of taxpayers in this situation.</p>
<p>The IRS has taken notice, and the tax agency has been waiving underpayment penalties and interest for many of the affected taxpayers. If you are completing your tax return and find that you owe money to the IRS, ask us about possible waivers for part of the amount due. You will still be responsible for the taxes you owe, but you may be able to get relief from any penalties and interest.</p>
<p>Owing money to the IRS is frightening, but the tax agency is not entirely lacking in compassion. The IRS knows that many taxpayers will have trouble making their payments in full, and the agency may be willing to set up a more affordable payment plan.</p>
<h3><strong>Seek Payment Arrangements with the IRS</strong></h3>
<p>If you receive a surprise tax bill you should try to pay what you owe, assuming it’s correct and your tax preparer already lowered your tax liability to the lowest amount allowed by law.</p>
<p>If you are unable to pay what you owe, contact our firm and we can help you setup a properly structured payment plan that can save you a lot in the long run.</p>
<p>Keep in mind you could be on the hook for additional penalties, as well as interest on your outstanding balance.</p>
<p>Owing money to the IRS is scary, and having a large tax liability can wreak havoc with your finances and your life. Even so, there are things you can do to ease the burden, so you can pay what you owe and send the IRS on its way. The steps outlined above can help you get a handle on the situation, so you can rest easy and stop worrying about your tax bill.</p>
<p>If you want an expert tax resolution professional who knows how to navigate the IRS maze, reach out to our firm and we’ll schedule a no-obligation confidential consultation to explain your options to permanently resolve your tax problem.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>“Not everyone is qualified to be a captain of a ship. When you’re miles from land and things get dicey, you want an Admiral, not a weekend sailor. You need a professional who knows what he or she is doing.”</strong></p>
<p>If your case gets remanded back to appeals, there are two other credentialed professionals that can represent you: the Certified Public Accountant and the Enrolled Agent.</p>
<p>Most tax return preparers provide outstanding service, however, they have differing levels of skill, as well as continuing education requirements and expertise.</p>
<p>Preparers with<strong> unlimited</strong> representation rights can represent their clients on any matters – including audits, payment collection issues, and appeals.</p>
<p>Preparers with<strong> limited</strong> representation rights can only represent clients whose returns they have prepared and signed.</p>
<h2><strong>Credentialed Return Preparers</strong></h2>
<p>Tax return preparers with <strong>unlimited</strong> rights include professionals with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enrolled Agents: Licensed by the IRS. Must pass a three-part Special Enrollment Examination. This is a comprehensive exam that requires them to demonstrate proficiency in federal tax planning, individual and business tax return preparation, and representation.</li>
<li>Attorneys: Licensed by state courts. Attorneys have earned a degree in law and have passed a bar exam. They may offer a range of services, and some specialize in tax preparation and planning.</li>
<li>Certified Public Accountants: Licensed by state courts. CPAs have passed the Uniform CPA Examination. They have completed a study of accounting at a college or university. They may offer a range of services, and some specialize in tax preparation and planning.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><img class="alignright wp-image-3539" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/The-Taxpayer-Representative-woman-sitting-desk-journal-note-taking-now-what-help-sfs-tax.jpg" alt="The Taxpayer Representative, woman, sitting, desk, journal, note taking, now what help, sfs tax" width="517" height="363" /></strong>If you are dealing with an audit, you cannot just walk into any tax return preparers’ office. Only an Enrolled Agent, a CPA, or an attorney can help you with an IRS issue.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>“Ask what those initials mean in the big scheme toward solving your problem. After all, you’ll be on the boat together and entrusting him or her with your financial life. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>You deserve to be certain you have the right one before you turn over the controls.” </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Where to Research for Preparers</strong></h2>
<p>The IRS has a searchable, sortable public directory at <a href="https://irs.treasury.gov/rpo/rpo.jsf">https://irs.treasury.gov/rpo/rpo.jsf</a> to search for various tax preparers.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Forget 10,000 Leagues Under the Sea. You’ll have to dive much deeper than that to get to the heart of the IRS.</strong></h2>
<p>When it comes to the administration and enforcement of our tax system, there are four basic levels:</p>
<h2><strong><img class="wp-image-3636 size-full alignright" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Chapter-Meme-B-1.jpg" alt="" width="526" height="526" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Chapter-Meme-B-1.jpg 526w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Chapter-Meme-B-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Chapter-Meme-B-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Chapter-Meme-B-1-500x500.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px" /></strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Examinations (Audits)</li>
<li>Collections</li>
<li>Appeals</li>
<li>Criminal Investigations</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s time to talk about the first three.</p>
<h2><strong>Examinations (Audits) </strong></h2>
<p>When a return is filed and processed, it is automatically deemed correct unless the IRS computers find an error.</p>
<h3><strong>What types of errors are picked up by the computers?</strong></h3>
<p>If you understate the income reported, overreport expenses, or report you had health insurance when you did not, the computer spits out a notice showing what they have compared to what you’ve put on your return.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you’ll get selected for audit (done locally or by mail). The auditor can pick up on these same errors or omissions.</p>
<h2><strong>Collections</strong></h2>
<p>The Internal Revenue Service is the world’s largest and most aggressive collection agency. Even with their funding woes, they can and will come after you (either in person or by mail <a href="https://sfstaxacct.com/2019/04/2019-dirty-dozen-list-of-tax-scams/">– never a phone call or email.</a>)</p>
<h2><strong><img class="alignright wp-image-3638 " src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/You-Have-It-We-Want-It-sfs-now-what-help-courtroom-courthouse-outside-2.jpg" alt="" width="427" height="645" /></strong></h2>
<p>One of the IRS collection units is the Automated Collections Service, or ACS. They have various service centers around the country. Then, there are Settlement Officers. These officials are usually in the IRS Appeals Office.</p>
<h2><strong>Appeals </strong></h2>
<p>A taxpayer usually gets one shot at appeals. The next step is to prepare and file a tax court petition. Generally, you can file this once you receive a 90-day notice (Statutory Notice of Deficiency.) You can prepare the petition:</p>
<ul>
<li>yourself</li>
<li>by a U.S. Tax Court Practitioner</li>
<li>by an attorney licensed to practice in your state</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, there is a $60 fee. You will wait until your petition gets on the court docket. Then, it is assigned to an IRS lawyer. Most of the time, IRS attorneys will “send it back to appeals,” because most cases are not USTC worthy (i.e. not enough money).</p>
<p>If you do not want to go to court (it is not cheap unless you do it yourself, and that is not highly recommended) and you cannot/do not pay, that is the crux of this book.</p>
<p>Just as you have the right to appeal an IRS decision, you also have the right to be represented.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Massachusetts Couple Could Face Long Prison Term</strong></h1>
<p>Gary DeCicco and Pamela Avedisian of Nahant, MA, were charged with multiple felonies. We&#8217;re talking two counts of tax evasion, one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud. They&#8217;ve also been charged with four counts of wire fraud and six counts of engaging in unlawful monetary transactions.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-3647 " src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Massachusetts-Couple-Could-Face-Long-Prison-Term-hands-handcuffs-white-wall-1.jpg" alt="" width="590" height="385" /></p>
<p>Between April 2012 and February 2013, DeCicco told the IRS that he did not have the ability to pay his more than $340,000 tax liability.  He repeatedly claimed he had very little cash, no vehicles or real properties during that time.</p>
<p>According to the IRS, he had ownership of several businesses, vehicles and real estate, titled to other entities to conceal his ownership from the IRS.</p>
<p>Originally, the IRS accepted a monthly installment plan based on false information.  During that time, DeCicco allegedly bought and sold numerous real properties, boats, luxury cars, concealing the sales with the help of Avedisian.</p>
<h2><strong>The Results of Their Fraud</strong></h2>
<p>The couple could face up to 5 years in prison for each count of tax evasion, up to 30 years for wire fraud and conspiracy to commit bank fraud, and up to 20 years for unlawful monetary transactions consecutively, as well as supervised release and monetary fines and penalties.</p>

Here’s What to Do.</strong></h1>
<p>The IRS takes unpaid payroll taxes seriously. These are some of the worst kind of back taxes you can owe. If you’re a small business owner with payroll tax problems, read on to learn what you can do to avoid the IRS crippling your business or worse, shut your business down completely.</p>
<p>And why would they do this? When you withhold taxes from employees’ checks, it is not yours. Not paying taxes is considered stealing.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-3674 " src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Small-Business-Owner-Owe-Payroll-Taxes-Here’s-What-to-Do-stressed-man-pay-phone-calling-making-phone-call-1.jpg" alt="Small Business Owner, Owe Payroll Taxes, Here’s What to Do, stressed, man, pay phone, calling, making phone call" width="510" height="497" /></p>
<h2><strong>Why Small Business Owners Get Into Payroll Tax Trouble In The First Place</strong></h2>
<p>It’s hard being a small business owner today, trying to pay your employees their paychecks every week, and pay the IRS all those payroll taxes.</p>
<p>A lot of times when money is short, you pay the employees first. You need to be able to take care of them even if it means not paying yourself.  If nothing else, the process of having to find new employees is a pain – don’t make them quit on you!</p>
<p>It can seem easy to “just pay it next pay period” and give yourself a little cash flow cushion, but skipping paying your employees payroll tax deposits is never a good idea.</p>
<p>What happens too often is one pay period turns into 2, and 3, and 4, and eventually you’re so deep in payroll tax debt that the only thing you want to do is completely ignore your problem.</p>
<p>The IRS doesn’t care if you can’t pay your employees.  They don’t care if they put your employees out on the street. It just doesn’t matter if you can’t collect your receivables.  They don’t care if one of your largest and best customers just went “belly-up”. You have money that belongs to them and they will do whatever they have to. They’ll put you out of business to collect it. They don’t care who you are or what business you are in.</p>
<h2><strong>Penalties are The Kiss Of Death When It Comes to Back Payroll Taxes</strong></h2>
<p>Penalties for failing to file and pay your payroll taxes are the “kiss of death” for any small business owner. They tack on penalties totaling 33% in just the first 16 days! And it doesn’t stop there.  The IRS adds interest on top of the penalties too. It is not uncommon that a payroll tax liability doubles in short order. And if you don’t pay them or work something out, they will shut you down. Why would a Revenue Officer want to work out an arrangement with you when shutting your business down is much less work?</p>
<h2><strong><img class="wp-image-3164 aligncenter" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Small-Business-Owner-Owe-Payroll-Taxes-Here’s-What-To-Do-chart-federal-tax-deposit-penalties.jpg" alt="Small Business Owner Owe Payroll Taxes Here’s What To Do, chart, federal tax deposit penalties" width="828" height="242" /></strong></h2>
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>The IRS Will Collect or They Will Shut You Down</strong></h2>
<p>It’s as simple as that.  The IRS is the most brutal collection agency on the planet.  They have more authority than the President of the United States. Therefore, they have all the ways and means to do whatever it takes to collect what’s owed to them. Even though you certainly didn’t expect to be short in funds, you weren’t avoiding payroll taxes because you didn’t want to. The money simply wasn’t there.  It’s not your fault.  One week you’re short of cash.  It was a slow week, a customer’s check bounced, or any number of legitimate reasons that just prevent you from paying the IRS.  The next week comes and goes, and you realize you still don’t have enough money to make that payroll tax deposit.  And then the entire situation starts “snow-balling” into an avalanche.</p>
<h2><strong>Should You Call The IRS To Get Your Payroll Issue Fixed? <img class="alignright wp-image-3675 " src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Small-Business-Owner-Owe-Payroll-Taxes-Here’s-What-to-Do-stress-colored-pencil-writing-red-1.jpg" alt="Small Business Owner, Owe Payroll Taxes, Here’s What to Do, stress, colored pencil, writing, red" width="488" height="362" /></strong></h2>
<p>If you were to call the IRS, and were able to get through after waiting on “hold” for an hour or more, and try to explain your situation—you might as well have a conversation with the wall—because they don’t care.  The IRS representative that you’re talking to probably makes less than $20 an hour, isn’t properly equipped to handle too many issues.  These representatives have probably never made a payroll in their life. Do you think they know what it’s like running a small business? Do you really think they will have any sympathy for you?</p>
<p>Not only is the answer “NO” but they can also dictate the fate of your case. What they will try to get, while you’re on the phone, is all your personal and financial information.  They want to know where you bank; they’ll want to know all about your customers who owe you money, they’ll want to know about the value of all your assets, like your home, cars, motorcycles, etc. Why? Because now they have all the information they need to levy your bank accounts, take your receivables and seize your property.</p>
<p>Plus, customer service is a misnomer. You are not their customer, the government is!</p>
<p>Now that you know you shouldn’t be talking to the IRS because they are not going to help you, you might be wondering what you should do?  Where should you turn for help?  They smartest thing you can do to protect your business and family is to have someone represent you—someone who deals with the IRS for a living. You need to get help from an experienced tax expert. An Enrolled Agent deals with the IRS every day, helping small business owners keep their businesses and settle IRS payroll tax problems.</p>
<h2><strong>Find a Resolution</strong></h2>
<p>Jeffrey Schneider EA, CTRS, NTPIF, ACT-E steps into your shoes and protects you from the IRS’s abusive tactics. He takes over all communications from the IRS on your behalf. Once they realize you have someone on your side protecting you, who knows their tricks as well as they do, they have to step back and follow the law.  Not only can he protect you from the IRS harassing you and showing up at your front door, he can get those penalties reduced and in some cases completely removed!</p>
<p>If you can’t pay on time, don’t ignore the letters or correspondence you get from the IRS. Reach out to us and we’ll schedule a no-obligation confidential consultation to explain your options to permanently resolve your tax problem. You can avoid a federal tax lien by simply filing and paying all your taxes in full and on time.</p>

<p>How long has it been? 3 years? More? 10? Some people have never filed taxes. Why not? <img class="alignright wp-image-3707 " src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Havent-Filed-Taxes-in-a-While-child-oops-shocked-face-tea-cup-1.jpg" alt="Haven't Filed Taxes in a While, child, oops, shocked face, tea cup" width="200" height="319" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“I knew I owed them, and I didn’t want to face the consequences.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“I couldn’t gather all of my records.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“My ex used to do them for me. I never learned how!”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“My accountant died.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“I’m in too deep.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“If I bring attention to the issue, the IRS is going to notice me and find things I never even <strong>realized</strong> I did wrong.”</em></p>
<h2><strong>Why Do We Have to File Tax Returns? </strong></h2>
<h2><strong><img class="alignright wp-image-3708 " src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Havent-Filed-Taxes-in-a-While-vacation-destination-beach-airplane-1.jpg" alt="" width="345" height="441" /></strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>It’s against the law not to file. This can be a felony… and you don’t it want following you the rest of your life.</li>
<li>If you’d like to buy or refinance a house, you need to prove that you’ve filed your returns.</li>
<li>If you want to get married one day, not filing can be a deal breaker because it carries <em>tons </em>of problems.</li>
<li>The IRS might file substitute-for-returns for you without deductions and you’ll owe them more than if you had just filed yourself.</li>
<li>If you owe $50,000 or more, your passport privileges will be revoked by the IRS. This means you can’t escape to Mexico before getting caught.</li>
<li>If you’re self-employed, you might miss out on increased Social Security contributions for when you retire.</li>
<li>You’re required to have filed to obtain health insurance.</li>
<li>You won’t be able to get student loan aid for your kids (FAFSA)</li>
<li>It will reduce your chances of having your identity stolen.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Do I Need to File Every Year?</strong></h2>
<p>Not typically, no. The IRS wants to see your last seven years of returns on file. However, if the IRS filed for you, you’ll want to replace the Substitute for Returns with returns of your own to reduce the balance they assessed. If you’re getting refunds and won’t owe taxes, you only have to worry about the last 4 years.</p>
<h2><strong>Alright, This is Too Much</strong></h2>
<p>Your Enrolled Agent will take thorough information on your tax situation and can handle this for you. Jeffrey A. Schneider EA, CTRS, NTPIF, ACT-E can determine exactly the number of years that need to be filed. He can find out whether the IRS has filed for you or not, find out whether or not you’ll be getting refunds that you may be entitled to, and set you up for future success.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Will My Income Tax Return be Audited?</strong></h1>
<p>For the vast majority of taxpayers, there is not much need to worry that you will be audited. In 2016, only 0.6% of individual income tax returns were audited according to the IRS <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/17databk.pdf">2017 Data Book</a>. Why? For starters, after the IRS budget cuts, we lost 2,200 agents that previously audited returns.</p>
<p>The “real” audit rate, however, is closer to 7.0%. The IRS does not include the over 9.2 million notices that are questioning items on your client’s tax returns (such as forgetting to include a 1099-Misc form).  The IRS is relying more and more on technology to uncover underreporting and underpayment of taxes.</p>
<p>The following are the different taxpayer groups are more susceptible to catching the attention of auditors.</p>
<p><img class="alignright  wp-image-2350" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Will-My-Income-Tax-Return-be-Audited-atlas-map-international-countries.jpg" alt="Will My Income Tax Return be Audited?" width="276" height="181" /></p>
<h3>Returns that report more than $10 Million in income or report no income</h3>
<p>Sixteen percent of individuals who reported over $10 million in income were audited in 2014. Surprisingly, the IRS audited those returns at a higher rate than those that reported no income.</p>
<p>The IRS audited 5.3% of tax returns with no income in 2014. If your income is $25,000 &#8211; $200,000, it is unlikely that you will be singled out for an audit.</p>
<h3><strong>Estate Tax Returns of More than $5 Million</strong></h3>
<p>In 2014, the IRS did an audit on 8.5% of estate tax returns which was well above the .9% of individual returns. 21% of even larger estate tax returns (between $5 million to $10 million) were audited, while 27% of those over $10 million received an audit.</p>
<h3><strong>Individual Filing of International Returns Raises a Red Flag</strong></h3>
<p>The IRS is focusing more attention on international returns. Statements made by experts in the field, strongly emphasized the practice of <a href="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/irs-forces-full-disclosure-for-overseas-accounts/">offshore tax evasion</a> as being fundamentally unfair. Wealthy people evading the law by stashing their money overseas and not paying their share of tax is forcing the bulk of lower income citizens to foot the bill to fund the government. In 2014, they audited 4.8% of international returns.</p>
<h3><strong>Errors in Information Entered</strong></h3>
<p>If someone filling out income tax forms makes simple, careless mistakes, red flags go up to the tax auditors. Filers neglect to get all report forms and statements together and forget to report dependents and exemptions correctly. The automated systems recognize these discrepancies, but can&#8217;t tell if they are actual mistakes or intentional. <a href="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/how-to-avoid-being-audited/">Neglecting to report all your income</a> and other figures could result in an audit especially at higher incomes. Those who contribute to more charities and other organizations open up the possibility for fraud.</p>
<h3><strong>Reports of Unrealistic Itemized Deductions<img class="alignright  wp-image-2351" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Will-My-Income-Tax-Return-be-Audited-finance-sheet-apple-coffee-camera-cactus.jpg" alt="Will My Income Tax Return be Audited, finance, sheet, apple, coffee, camera, cactus" width="355" height="234" /></strong></h3>
<p>An individual or small business could be signaled out for an audited if they claim itemized deductions that are clearly out of line. Filers need to know what a legitimate deduction entails.</p>
<p>Carefully reading directions for completing forms and checking for accuracy and honesty will reduce the chances of an audit. Hiring a tax professional, specifically someone with tax resolution experience like our firm, can help you stay out of tax trouble.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://people.com/tag/shakira/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2300" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Shakira.png" alt="" width="1590" height="836" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Shakira.png 1590w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Shakira-300x158.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Shakira-768x404.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Shakira-1024x538.png 1024w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Shakira-700x368.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1590px) 100vw, 1590px" /></a></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Shakira Pays $25 Million in Back Taxes</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://people.com/tag/shakira/">Shakira</a> has reportedly paid a major bill for back taxes owed to the Spanish government.</p>
<p>According to numerous reports, this international superstar has paid more than 20 million Euros &#8211; or $25 million &#8211; to the Spanish authorities to settle part of a tax fraud debt pending ongoing investigation.</p>
<p>The investigation seeks to establish whether Shakira legally resided in Spain with her longtime boyfriend, Barcelona Futbol Club soccer player Gerard Piqué, between the years 2011 and 2014.<img class="alignright  wp-image-2302" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Shakira-Pays-25-Million-in-Back-Taxes.jpg" alt="Shakira Pays $25 Million in Back Taxes, Barcelona, architecture, building, ancient" width="303" height="265" /></p>
<p>Spanish law states that if an individual spends more than 183 days in the country, they are considered a legal resident and liable for paying taxes on income acquired internationally. However, those spending fewer than 183 days in Spain would only be accountable for income earned within the country.</p>
<h3>The Defense Has Spoken</h3>
<p>Shakira, 41, reportedly claimed that she had spent the majority of those years as a resident of the Bahamas. She claims to have filed her taxes accordingly. In documents obtained by both <em>El Periodico</em> and <em>El Pais,</em> the singer’s defense claimed that she had indeed spent most of her time abroad, and made no effort to intentionally hide her income, citing any misunderstandings as “a difference in criteria.”</p>
<p>It was confirmed that in 2009, Shakira relocated her intellectual property rights and brands to a company based in Malta. Malta is known for and has faced allegations of being a tax heaven.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-2301" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Shakira-Pays-25-Million-in-Back-Taxes-shakira-court-courtroom-stressed.jpg" alt="Shakira Pays $25 Million in Back Taxes, shakira, court, courtroom, stressed" width="270" height="176" />Spanish press reports have detailed extensive efforts of local tax authorities to establish Shakira’s place of residence during the years in question. They’ve begun studying photos of the star out and about in Spain to piece together her story. They even interviewed her hairstylist.</p>
<p>Shakira’s reported payment covers the amount owed for 2011, while the investigation into taxes owed for 2012-2014 remains ongoing, <em>El Periodico </em>claims. Once completed, the district attorney and the Agencia Estatal de Administración Tributaria (Spanish Tax Agency; their equivalence of our Internal Revenue Service) are expected to decide if tax fraud charges will be brought. Then, the case will proceed to court.</p>
<h3><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h3>
<p>If she did commit tax fraud, Shakira would join a <a href="https://www.thetaxdefensegroup.com/five-famous-people-who-committed-tax-fraud/">list</a> of celebrities who have been in trouble with tax authorities.</p>

Attempting to cut your tax liability by getting into IRS grey areas can cause you problems later on. You don&#8217;t have to do anything unethical to get your return pulled for an audit; you may just have raised too many red flags. Also, an audit can be done via letter, (i.e. <a href="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/now-what-i-got-a-cp2000-notice-help/">CP2000 Notice</a>) not just face-to-face. If you’re in the middle of an audit, or owe back taxes, contact Jeffrey Schneider, EA, CTRS to resolve your tax problem(s). Here are the top 10 red flags the IRS target that you want to avoid:</p>
<h3><strong>1. Making too much money</strong></h3>
<p>First, here&#8217;s a problem most of us would dream to have. Making over $200,000! You&#8217;re honestly more likely to be audited. The fact is that there are fewer auditors, so the IRS is focusing on where they can make the most bang for their buck.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Not reporting all of your income </strong></h3>
<p>No matter how much or little you make, you have to report everything. In some way or other, unless you run a strictly cash business, all of your income is reported to the IRS. W2, 1099 and other forms you receive are duplicated, then they are sent in to the IRS. If your reported income doesn&#8217;t match theirs, you will get a notice.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Math errors </strong></h3>
<p>Your information will be entered into a computer whether you file electronically or file a paper form. Remember, the one thing computers are very good at is doing math and if things don’t add up, or there was an honest mistake while inputting the information, it can raise a red flag. A math error won&#8217;t necessarily generate an audit, but it will get the attention you may not want. Make sure to double check your returns. Better yet, have a qualified tax professional assist you and keep you out of tax trouble.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Home businesses that never make money<img class="alignright wp-image-1933" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/How-to-Avoid-Being-Audited-cartoon-woman-shocked-thinking-i-thought-i-could-just-write-it-off.jpg" alt="How to Avoid Being Audited, cartoon woman, shocked, thinking, i thought i could just write it off" width="262" height="388" /></strong></h3>
<p>Sole proprietorships that file a Schedule C year after year and always show a loss will raise a red flag. You could even show a profit, but if the profit margin is always unreasonably small, then that will get the IRS&#8217; attention.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Large charitable deductions</strong></h3>
<p>There is nothing wrong with being charitable and there is no legal limit to how much of your hard earned cash you can give away. It is another red flag, however, if your donation is different than what’s considered the norm.</p>
<h3><strong>6. Overstating business expenses</strong></h3>
<p>Depending on the type of job you have, there can be many legitimate expenses that your employer doesn&#8217;t reimburse you for. Don&#8217;t be tempted to write off just a little extra if you have your own business. These might be genuine deductions you&#8217;re considering. However, you don&#8217;t want to deduct something that&#8217;s not on the approved list and don&#8217;t claim deductions way outside the norm. Check with your tax professional – or if you don’t have one, consider Jeffrey Schneider, EA, CTRS, NPTI Fellow &#8211; who is up to date with tax laws. You don’t want to be padding your tax return with write-offs.</p>
<h3><strong>7. Sketchy real estate rental revenue or losses</strong></h3>
<p>Some people will &#8216;rent&#8217; their property to friends or family at well below market value and then claim normal rental business expenses. As with other areas, the IRS compares what you claim against local standards to determine if this is a legit business. If not, they will disallow the deductions.</p>
<h3><strong>8. Home office deductions</strong></h3>
<p>There are absolutely legitimate home office deductions but the IRS has very strict guidelines on what you can claim and how much. Try to claim too much and this is a classic red flag.</p>
<h3><strong>9. Claiming losses for things that aren&#8217;t deductible or deductible in your circumstances </strong></h3>
<p>For example, claiming day-trading losses on a Schedule C. If you dabble in stock trading and take a loss, it may or may not be deductible, but almost certainly doesn&#8217;t qualify for a Schedule C loss. You also can&#8217;t take a deduction for alimony as a business expense. The IRS maintains a list of non-deductible expenses, make sure to check that and check with your tax professional.</p>
<h3><strong><img class="alignright wp-image-1934" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/How-to-Avoid-Being-Audited-red-bentley-mountains-cloudy-skies-interior-car.jpg" alt="How to Avoid Being Audited, red, bentley, mountains, cloudy, skies, interior, car" width="324" height="226" /></strong></h3>
<h3><strong>10. Claiming 100% business use of your vehicle</strong></h3>
<p>If you spend most of the time in your vehicle doing your job, you may think it&#8217;s easier just to claim the whole amount as a business expense, but this is wrong. You will either have to show your personal use, no matter how small, or have to show you have a second vehicle for personal use.</p>
<h2><strong>How it Gets Confusing</strong></h2>
<p>Many of these items are red flags for an audit, but many are also legitimate deductions. The key is to have a qualified tax professional on your side. When it comes to tax resolution, Jeffrey Schneider, EA, CTRS knows how to navigate the IRS maze. He can help you minimize the risk of an audit and the resulting tax problems down the road. Also, he will ensure you have meticulous records and keep you within the guidelines of the IRS.</p>
<p>If you need an expert tax resolution professional, reach out to us and we’ll schedule a no-obligation confidential consultation. Jeffrey Schneider, EA, CTRS will explain your options and help permanently resolve your tax problem.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Miami-Dade Police Officer Arrested for Stealing Thousands in Federal Funds While in College</strong></h2>
<p>Ebony Nesbitt’s tax fraud past may have caught up with her. Fraudulent tax refunds are practically unforgivable with the IRS. If she is convicted, the choices she made in college will severely impact her future.  She was relieved of duty without pay from the Miami-Dade Police Force and may serve up to 15 years in prison.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-1921" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Miami-Dade-Police-Officer-Arrested-for-Stealing-Thousands-in-Federal-Funds-While-in-College-girl-college-library.jpg" alt="Miami-Dade Police Officer Arrested for Stealing Thousands in Federal Funds While in College, girl, college, library" width="269" height="200" /></p>
<p>When Nesbitt was attending Miami-Dade College in 2013, federal prosecutors say she joined a ring of students who stole other people&#8217;s identities to file fake tax returns seeking nearly $2 million in refunds. Nesbitt and many others received thousands of dollars in their college bank accounts.</p>
<p>She was not among the 18 MDC students arrested in 2014 as the U.S. attorney&#8217;s office froze more than 1,000 student bank accounts used to deposit fraudulently obtained tax refunds. The ring filed returns in the names of about 650 taxpayers whose Social Security numbers were stolen. As a result, the IRS issued almost $500,000 in refunds.</p>
<p>Four years after the college scandal, Nesbitt serves as a Miami-Dade police officer. But not for long, because the 28-year-old North Miami woman was arrested. She received charges of a conspiracy against the U.S. government and theft of federal funds.</p>
<h3><strong>Results Pending</strong></h3>
<p>They released Nesbitt on a $50,000 bond. The police force also relieved her of duty without pay pending the outcome of her criminal case. Nesbitt joined the police force in 2014 and sadly enough, this was not her first time in the news.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-1919" title="Miami-Dade Police Officer Arrested for Stealing Thousands in Federal Funds While in College, court, judge, gavel" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Miami-Dade-Police-Officer-Arrested-for-Stealing-Thousands-in-Federal-Funds-While-in-College-court-judge-gavel.jpg" alt="Miami-Dade Police Officer Arrested for Stealing Thousands in Federal Funds While in College, court, judge, gavel" width="164" height="197" />The case by the FBI and U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office was made as the statute of limitations was going to expire. In a separate but recent incident, Nesbitt&#8217;s former boyfriend, Andrew Morales, was charged with two counts of theft of government funds. Morales received two electronic tax refunds from the Treasury Department. He received $7,568 and $9,353 &#8211; both in the names of other people. Seems a little fishy…</p>
<h3><strong>How She Did It</strong></h3>
<p>Nesbitt and her co-conspirators obtained the names, dates of birth and Social Security numbers of other people for filing bogus tax returns &#8211; then arranged to have the electronic refunds deposited into the Higher One bank accounts of Miami Dade College students. Those accounts are for receiving financial aid and paying tuition.</p>
<p>Nesbitt and her co-conspirators &#8220;designated&#8221; her Higher One account for the direct deposit of federal tax refunds. On Oct. 2, 2013, Nesbitt&#8217;s account received a wire transfer totaling $7,573 from the Treasury Department in the name of another person.</p>
<p>That same day, an unnamed co-conspirator withdrew about $502 from Nesbitt&#8217;s Higher One account. She used a debit card in her name. Eight days later, Nesbitt received a check totaling $7,068.50 from Higher One when the banking-service company closed her Miami Dade College account.</p>
