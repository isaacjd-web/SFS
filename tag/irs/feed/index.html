			<p>Of all the creditors or companies, you might owe money to, the Internal Revenue Service can be the least forgiving about debt. If you don&#8217;t pay your taxes, the IRS will levy and take possession of your property, including cash accounts, wages, and real and personal property. The IRS will sell non-liquid assets to raise funds to satisfy the debt you owe.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If you&#8217;ve received a levy notice from the IRS, it&#8217;s time to ACT IMMEDIATELY. Our firm may be able to get your levy released the same day, but you must call now for a confidential consultation. 877-355-8010 or   <a href="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/contact-us-at-sfs-tax-problem-solutions-in-stuart/">https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/contact-us-at-sfs-tax-problem-solutions-in-stuart/</a></span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Unless you don&#8217;t open your mail or you moved without leaving a forwarding address, you probably won&#8217;t be blindsided by an IRS levy. You&#8217;ll receive a &#8220;Notice and Demand for Payment&#8221; of your tax debt well in advance of any action taken. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If you ignore this notice, the IRS will follow up by sending you a &#8220;Final Notice of Intent to Levy and Notice of Your Rights to a Hearing.&#8221; Now the clock begins ticking. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">You have 30 days to pay your tax debt or to contact the IRS to try to stop the levy. Even if you&#8217;re unaware of the levy proceedings, your employer has a little bit of time to warn you if he receives notice that the IRS plans to take the bulk (which can be up to 90%) of your paychecks. Your employer doesn&#8217;t have to begin sending your earnings to the IRS until the next pay period. With any luck, your employer will let you know what&#8217;s going on within this time frame so that you can take action. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If the IRS levies your bank account, the bank will freeze the money in the account and remit it to the IRS after 21 days. Therefore, you must act quickly to try to have the funds released upon receiving a notice that the IRS has levied your bank account. </span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Contact A Tax Relief Firm</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Now is not the time to do it alone. If you call the IRS, they will often trick you into giving incriminating answers, further distancing you for the tax relief you so desperately need. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The IRS is NOT your friend. They are there to collect what they believe you owe in taxes. Contact a professional experienced in tax resolution to help you with your case. Would you go to court without a lawyer? Well, it&#8217;s the same with the IRS. You need professional representation from an Enrolled Agent, CPA, or tax attorney who is also a tax resolution specialist.</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Establish Hardship </span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If the IRS intends to levy your paycheck or Social Security benefits and you can&#8217;t come close to making ends meet on what&#8217;s left, the IRS wants you to contact them. The contact phone number should appear on the levy notice. DO NOT CALL THE IRS.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The law requires that the IRS leave you with the total of your tax exemptions for the year plus your standard deduction divided by 52 if you&#8217;re paid weekly. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Gather your documents and call us. We&#8217;ll help make the case to the IRS and explain that the levy will cause hardship for you and your family. You&#8217;ll have to provide documented evidence of this, but if you do, the IRS will release the levy. This doesn&#8217;t mean you no longer owe the tax. It just means that the IRS will leave your earnings and income alone and work with you to figure out some other way for you to satisfy the debt. </span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Make Payment Arrangements </span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">We can also ask for payment terms for your tax debt even if the levy won&#8217;t cripple you financially. If you enter into an installment agreement, the IRS will typically release the levy unless the notice you received specifically states otherwise. </span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">You Can &#8220;Settle&#8221; For Less Than You Owe</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">An offer in compromise allows you to settle your tax debt for less than the full amount you owe. It may be a legitimate option if you can&#8217;t pay your full tax liability or doing so creates a financial hardship. The IRS considers your unique set of facts and circumstances:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Ability to pay;</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Income;</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Expenses; and</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Asset equity.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The IRS will generally approve an offer in compromise when the amount offered represents the most they can expect to collect within a reasonable period of time. It&#8217;s best to explore all other payment options before submitting an offer in compromise as the Offer in Compromise program is not for everyone. Make sure you hire a tax professional to help you file an offer and be sure to check his or her qualifications.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The IRS doesn&#8217;t want to destroy you financially. They just want the money they are owed. If you can make an arrangement to pay or prove that you don&#8217;t owe the tax, or if you legitimately cannot pay it at this time, you may be able to make the levy go away. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Our firm specializes in tax resolution, even if you have years of unfiled tax returns, we can help! If you want a Certified Tax Resolution Specialist who knows how to navigate the IRS maze, reach out to our firm and we&#8217;ll schedule a no-obligation confidential consultation to explain your options to permanently resolve your tax problem. <a href="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/contact-us-at-sfs-tax-problem-solutions-in-stuart/">https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/contact-us-at-sfs-tax-problem-solutions-in-stuart/ </a></span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This article about Cryptocurrency Tax Loss Harvesting explains:</p>
<ul>
<li>what is tax loss harvesting</li>
<li>how you can use this method to reduce your cryptocurrency tax liability</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the most effective ways to reduce your tax bill for the year is to engage in tax loss harvesting with your cryptocurrency assets. It’s common knowledge that cryptocurrencies are incredibly volatile. Realizing your tax loss and other characteristics make it a useful candidate for tax loss harvesting strategies.</p>
<h4>What is Tax Loss Harvesting?</h4>
<p>Tax Loss Harvesting is the practice of selling a capital asset at a loss to offset a capital gains tax liability. By realizing or “harvesting” a loss, investors can offset taxes on both gains and income. This is a tax reduction strategy often used in the world of stocks and securities.</p>
<h5>Let’s look at a general example:</h5>
<p>Beth buys $1,000 of Microsoft stock and $2,000 of Apple stock in a given year. While holding these investments, the value of her Microsoft stock rises to $1,500, while Apple drops to $1,700. She sells all of his Microsoft stock for $1,500.</p>
<h5>Without Tax Loss Harvesting</h5>
<p>Without harvesting her losses in Microsoft stock, Beth has a $500 capital gain for the year from the sale of her Microsoft stock. She pays taxes on all $500 of this capital gain.</p>
<h5>With Tax Loss Harvesting</h5>
<p>Rather than continuing to hold her Apple stock, Beth can harvest her losses in Apple by selling before the year-end. Capital gains and losses get added together for the year resulting in either a net gain or loss. Her net capital gain is now only $200 for the year ($500 &#8211; $300). In this scenario, Beth only pays taxes on $200 of net capital gains rather than $500.</p>
<h4>All About Cryptocurrency Tax Loss Harvesting</h4>

<p>Cryptocurrencies are always treated as property for tax purposes, the same as traditional stocks. This means that you can strategically sell or trade crypto to harvest losses and reduce your tax liability. However, unlike stocks, cryptocurrencies have unique characteristics that make them even better candidates for tax loss harvesting.</p>
<h5>Wash Sale Rules</h5>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; white-space: normal; background-color: #ffffff;"> </span>A wash sale results when you sustain a capital loss and then repurchase the same security within 30-days. This is before or after the capital loss is incurred. It was designed to prevent investors from taking capital losses in one year and then immediately buying back the stock. The <a href="https://www.irs.gov/publications/p550#en_US_2016_publink100010601">IRS</a> states that the wash sale rules apply only to securities. It was deemed that Cryptocurrencies are property, and not securities, as defined by the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-21.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IRS guidance</a>. This means that currently, the wash sales rules do not apply to cryptocurrency.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Volatility</h5>
<ul>
<li>Cryptocurrencies are very volatile, more so than traditional assets. This volatility means that investors have extensive opportunities to realize and harvest capital losses. The problematic part for investors is identifying which of the cryptocurrencies (in their portfolios) have the highest cost basis (original purchase price) when they are compared to the current market price. These are the assets that present the most significant opportunity for tax savings.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Let’s look at another example:</h4>
<p>Alan has made $15,000 in capital gains from investing in the stock market this year. He has also been investing in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, XRP, and Ethereum. In December, he notices that his investments are down over $20,000 for the year. To harvest these losses, Alan trades all of his cryptocurrencies into Litecoin.  Thus incurring a <em>taxable event</em> and realizing his losses. Alan’s losses in cryptocurrency completely offset all of his stock market gains, and he then will have a capital loss for the year of $5000.</p>
<h4>Net Capital Losses Up to $3,000 Offset Ordinary Income</h4>
<ul>
<li>When total capital gains and losses for the year add up to a loss, a net capital loss is then incurred.</li>
<li>If the net capital loss is less than or equal to $3,000 ($1,500 if you are married and filing a separate tax return), then that entire capital loss can be used to offset other types of income &#8211; such as the job-related income.</li>
<li>Net losses exceeding $3,000 are rolled forward to subsequent years.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Sell or Trade Once Detected</h4>
<ul>
<li>Once you determine which cryptocurrencies present the best tax savings opportunities, you can then sell or trade them on your exchange of choice. You must understand that selling or trading your crypto will trigger a <em>taxable event</em> and “realize” your losses in the asset. December 31st is the deadline.</li>
</ul>
<p>The tax year ends on Dec. 31<sup>st</sup>, even though the filing deadline isn’t until April 15th. This means that you must realize your losses before the end of the year if you want them to impact that year’s taxes.</p>
<p>Many investors delay only to discover that they could have saved money on their tax bill if they would have sold or taken their losses in December. And by then it’s too late.</p>

			<h4>F is for First Time Penalty Abatement</h4>
<ul>
<li>The first time penalty abatement (FTA) waiver is an administrative waiver that the IRS may grant to relieve taxpayers from failure-to-file, failure-to-pay and failure-to-deposit penalties if certain criteria are met.</li>
<li>The IRS also removes interest related to those penalties.</li>
</ul>
<p>First Time Penalty Abatement is an option that may be available to taxpayers to remove IRS penalties that have been assessed to a tax debt. However, not everyone qualifies for penalty abatement. Also, not all penalties are eligible for penalty abatement. Some of the most common penalties that are able to be abated are failure to file, failure to pay, and failure to deposit estimated tax.</p>
<h5>You may qualify for administrative relief from penalties for failing to file a tax return, pay on time, and/or to deposit taxes when due under the IRS First Time Penalty Abatement policy if you meet the following:</h5>
<ul>
<li>A taxpayer didn’t previously have to file a return, or you have no penalties for the 3 tax years prior to the tax year in which you received a penalty.</li>
<li>You filed all currently required returns or filed an extension of time to file.</li>
<li>You have paid, or arranged to pay, any tax due.</li>
</ul>
<p>The failure-to-pay penalty will continue to accrue, until the tax is paid in full. It may be to your advantage to wait until you fully pay the tax due prior to requesting penalty relief under the Service&#8217;s first-time penalty abatement policy. The penalty is 5% of your balance per month.</p>
<p>Interest charged on a penalty will be reduced or removed when that penalty is reduced or removed. If an unpaid balance remains on your account, interest will continue to accrue until the account is full paid.</p>
<p>Other administrative relief: If you received incorrect oral advice from the IRS, you may qualify for administrative relief.</p>
<p>Determining whether a situation or event qualifies a taxpayer for penalty relief can be tricky. Seeking professional help from an Enrolled Agent and Certified Tax Resolution Specialist is helpful not only because the tax professional is familiar with the qualifications for penalty abatement, but also, they will know how to properly organize and submit your request.  Discover how to solve your tax problem by speaking with us today. <a href="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/media/"> Find out more about me</a>.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Tax Resolution Alphabet -E is for (Tax) Evasion. Tax evasion occurs when a person or business illegally avoids paying their tax liability, which is a criminal charge that’s subject to penalties and fines.</p>
<h4><strong>Overview:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Tax evasion can be either the illegal non-payment or underpayment of actual tax liabilities due.</li>
<li>Tax evasion can be determined by the IRS regardless of whether or not tax forms were filed with the agency.</li>
<li>To determine tax evasion, the agency must be able to show that the avoidance of taxes was willful on the part of the taxpayer.</li>
<li>While tax evasion is illegal, tax avoidance includes finding legal ways (within the law) to reduce taxpayer obligations.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is tax evasion?</strong></h4>
<p>Tax evasion is an illegal activity in which a person or entity deliberately avoids paying a tax liability. Individuals caught evading taxes are usually subject to criminal charges and substantial penalties. To willfully fail to pay taxes is a federal offense under the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax code.</p>
<p>In order for charges to be levied, it must be determined that the avoidance of taxes was a willful act on the part of the taxpayer. Not only can a person be liable for payment of any taxes that have been left unpaid, but they can also be found guilty of criminal and civil charges and may be required to serve jail time. According to the IRS, the penalties include jail time of no more than five years, a fine of no more than $250,000 for individuals or $500,000 for corporations, or both—along with the costs of prosecution.</p>
<p>When determining if the act of failure to pay was intentional, a variety of factors are considered. Most commonly, a taxpayer’s financial situation will be examined in an effort to confirm if the nonpayment was the result of committing fraud or of the concealment of reportable income. Unlike in an audit where the burden of proof falls to the taxpayer, in a criminal situation the IRS/Department of Justice bears the burden.<img class="alignright  wp-image-4321" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/CID-shield-handcuffs-1040-form-300x158.png" alt="CID shield-handcuffs-1040 form" width="384" height="202" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/CID-shield-handcuffs-1040-form-300x158.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/CID-shield-handcuffs-1040-form-768x404.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/CID-shield-handcuffs-1040-form.png 1000w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/CID-shield-handcuffs-1040-form-700x368.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 384px) 100vw, 384px" /></p>
<h5><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_evasion_in_the_United_States">E is for (Tax) Evasion </a></h5>
<p>A failure to pay may be judged fraudulent in cases where a taxpayer made efforts to conceal assets by associating them with a person other than themselves. This can include reporting income under a false name and Social Security number (SSN), which can also constitute identity theft. A person may be judged as concealing income for failure to report work that did not follow traditional payment recording methods. This can include acceptance of a cash payment for goods or services rendered without reporting them properly to the IRS during a tax filing.</p>
<p>In most cases of<a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-utl/tax_crimes_handbook.pdf"> corporate tax evasion listed on the IRS website</a>, the tax liability was underrepresented. Many business owners undervalued the sums of their receipts to the agency, an act which was deemed to be the purposeful evasion of tax. These were documented to be sources of income, revenue, and profits that were not accurately reported.</p>

			<h4><strong>The Tax Resolution Alphabet &#8211; D is for Debt Relief</strong></h4>
<p>If you are struggling with IRS tax debt and feel like it’s a hopeless situation, it may not be as  awful as you think. The IRS Fresh Start Program was created to make it easier and more accessible for people to repay or settle their tax debt.</p>
<p>Taxes often seem overwhelming and overly complex, almost like a project that you didn’t research and were unable to complete.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Fresh Start Program</strong></h5>
<p>The IRS initiated its Fresh Start Program in 2008 and expanded it in 2012 to ease the financial burdens of taxpayers who owe up to $50,000 in taxes. It is available to both business owners and individual taxpayers</p>
<p>The program is designed to allow taxpayers to pay off substantial tax debts affordably over the course of six years. Each month, taxpayers make payments that are based on their current income and the value of their liquid assets.</p>
<p>It simplifies the process of paying back large tax debts. It also helps people avoid many of the damages of owing a tax debt to the IRS including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accrued Interest</li>
<li>Recurring Penalties</li>
<li>Tax liens</li>
<li>Seizure of assets</li>
<li>Wage garnishments</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong> Qualifies for the Fresh Start Program?</strong></h5>
<p>In order to qualify for the IRS Fresh Start Program for debt settlement or lien withdrawals, generally you&#8217;ll need a couple of things at a minimum:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any missing or unfiled tax returns must be filed.</li>
<li>You are current with your estimated tax payments or your current withholdings are correct, and they have been so for the last 6 months.</li>
</ul>

			<p style="text-align: left;">C is for the <em>Currently Not Collectible</em><em> </em><em>Status </em>from the IRS</p>
<p>Big companies are known for getting all sorts of breaks, but when average people fall behind, they rarely receive help. When you owe back taxes, but can’t afford to pay them, then you may qualify for a special tax status known as <em>currently not collectible</em>.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-4118 alignleft" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/C-is-for-currently-not-collectible-300x158.png" alt="" width="391" height="206" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/C-is-for-currently-not-collectible-300x158.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/C-is-for-currently-not-collectible-768x404.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/C-is-for-currently-not-collectible.png 1000w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/C-is-for-currently-not-collectible-700x368.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 391px) 100vw, 391px" /></p>
<p>If you’re IRS approved for currently not collectible status, they must not only cease its collection efforts, but they can no longer garnish your wages or seize your property.</p>
<p>Want to know if you qualify for currently not collectible status? Contact our firm here for a specific evaluation of your situation. <em>Visit our website, <a href="http://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/">sfstaxproblemsolutions.com</a> to book your <strong>Free Debt Settlement Analysis</strong> at </em><a href="https://go.oncehub.com/jeffreyschneider"><strong>https://go.oncehub.com/jeffreyschneider</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>What is Currently Not Collectible Status? </strong></p>
<p>If the IRS agrees that you can’t pay your back taxes and cover your reasonable living expenses, they may place your account in the Currently Not Collectible status.  This determination is based on your <img class="alignright wp-image-4111" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-300x300.png" alt="warning sign, do not try this alone" width="269" height="269" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-300x300.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-150x150.png 150w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-768x768.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-570x570.png 570w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-500x500.png 500w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-1000x1000.png 1000w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-700x700.png 700w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 269px) 100vw, 269px" />current financial situation.</p>
<p>You can request currently not collectible status by submitting the proper form and proof to the IRS of your income and expenses, as well as whether you can sell any assets you may have or get a loan.</p>
<p>As you’ll need to be able to document your inability to pay, be sure to gather copies of all your bills, your most recent paycheck stubs, and statements detailing other sources of income such as alimony, pensions or investments. If the IRS determines that your necessary expenses exceed your income, then it will notify you of your Currently Not Collectable status.</p>
<p>WARNING: Don’t try to do this alone. We recommend reaching out to our tax resolution firm to guide you through your options. Talking to the IRS directly could be like shooting yourself in the foot. They’ll ask you very invasive questions that could land you in deeper trouble. Remember, the IRS is not your friend. Their job is to collect what they believe you owe them, so it’s best to have a professional in your corner.</p>
<p><strong>Not a Permanent Solution</strong></p>
<p>Keep in mind that currently not collectible status applies only to your back taxes. You will still have to file tax returns, and you will not be exempted from paying current and future taxes. You will also continue to accumulate penalties and interest on your unpaid taxes. After a year or two, the IRS may review your status, and if you’re able to begin paying your back taxes, then you must do so. If you’re still not able to pay, then your status will be renewed.</p>
<p><strong>Statute of Limitations   </strong></p>
<p>The IRS can attempt to collect outstanding taxes for only ten years from the date the taxes were assessed against you; usually, that’s the date you filed. If at the end of this 10-year period the IRS hasn’t collected, then the taxes are no longer owed.</p>
<p>In difficult times, many families have trouble meeting their commitments. If you’re worried about the IRS garnishing your wages, levying your bank account, or taking your home, then reaching out to our firm and getting a free, no-obligation, confidential consultation on your tax problem may give you some peace of mind.

			<p><strong>Owe Money to the IRS? It&#8217;s Called Back Taxes</strong></p>
<p>Back taxes refer to taxes owed from a prior year.</p>
<p>A taxpayer may be behind in paying taxes for intentional or negligent reasons. Some of these reasons include – filing a return and failing to pay the tax liability; failing to report all income earned during the tax year, and; neglecting to file a tax return for a given tax year.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-4126 alignleft" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Do-you-suffer-from-FOF_Fear-of-Filing-300x300.png" alt="" width="211" height="211" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Do-you-suffer-from-FOF_Fear-of-Filing-300x300.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Do-you-suffer-from-FOF_Fear-of-Filing-150x150.png 150w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Do-you-suffer-from-FOF_Fear-of-Filing-768x768.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Do-you-suffer-from-FOF_Fear-of-Filing-570x570.png 570w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Do-you-suffer-from-FOF_Fear-of-Filing-500x500.png 500w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Do-you-suffer-from-FOF_Fear-of-Filing-700x700.png 700w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Do-you-suffer-from-FOF_Fear-of-Filing.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 211px) 100vw, 211px" /></p>
<p>If taxes remain unpaid after multiple notices have been sent by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), a minimum penalty fee of $135 will be charged in addition to interest on the unpaid amount, which is 0.5% per month that the taxpayer is late, up to 25%. As the total tax debt increases each month due to penalty and interest, over time, it can grow into a significant amount.</p>
<p>Do you have FOF, fear of filing? We can file all of your deinquent returns and help you with the penalties and interest.  Contact our firm here for an evaluation of your situation. <em>Visit our website, <a href="http://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/">sfstaxproblemsolutions.com</a> to book your <strong>Free Debt Settlement Analysis</strong> at </em><a href="https://go.oncehub.com/jeffreyschneider"><strong>https://go.oncehub.com/jeffreyschneider.</strong></a></p>
<p>Unpaid back taxes can be a serious issue for many taxpayers who don&#8217;t have the means to pay them. Depending upon the circumstances, the government may take one of many strategies to deal with back taxes, such as pressing charges, demanding that that the taxpayer pay immediately, or sometimes offering a voluntary disclosure program which helps avoid criminal charges and allows a variety of payment options. Failure to pay taxes can also involve imprisonment.</p>
<p>In some cases, the IRS will seize property, seize assets, or place liens on property. The IRS may place a federal tax lien to inform other creditors of the taxing authorities legal right to a taxpayer’s assets and property. The IRS also has the power to garnish a taxpayer’s wages and to levy their financial accounts, seizing up to the total amount of taxes owed. If the taxes remain unpaid, the tax authority can use a tax levy to legally seize the taxpayer&#8217;s assets (such as bank accounts, investment accounts, automobiles, and real property) in order to collect the money, it is owed. While a lien secures the government’s interest or claim in an individual’s or business’ property when the tax debt remains unpaid, a levy actually permits the government to seize and sell the property in order to pay the tax debt.</p>

			<p>IRS Appeals</p>
<p>An unexpected envelope from the Internal Revenue Service is never a good thing.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s never pleasant, but any letter that you receive should not be ignored, especially if you disagree with an IRS decision.</p>
<p>In fact, the IRS Taxpayer Bill of Rights covers this specific situation as one of a taxpayer&#8217;s rights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay no more than the correct amount of tax,</li>
<li>Challenge the IRS&#8217; position and be heard and</li>
<li>Appeal an IRS decision in an independent forum</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some tips on getting through an IRS disagreement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get professional help: First, if you don&#8217;t have a tax professional, get one.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if your disputed tax situation is not that complicated, dealing with the IRS can be difficult. A tax professional that has standing with the IRS, like an Enrolled Agent (EA), CPA, or attorney with experience in resolving issues between the IRS and taxpayers can save you time, and money. A Certified Tax Resolution Specialist (CTRS) is specially trained to argue your case before the IRS.</p>
<ul>
<li>Know the general appeals process: Your tax pro will help you understand what to expect and what happens during your appeal process.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Appeals Office is separate from and independent of the IRS office that took action against you. It&#8217;s also the only level of administrative appeal within the IRS.</p>
<p>Conferences with an Appeals Office representative can be held informally by correspondence, telephone, or at a face-to-face meeting.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to have official representation at an appeals conference, but as noted at the beginning of this post, it&#8217;s generally a good idea.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4156" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IRS-letter-300x251.png" alt="IRS letter-sfs tax problem solutions" width="300" height="251" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IRS-letter-300x251.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IRS-letter-768x644.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IRS-letter-700x587.png 700w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IRS-letter.png 940w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Preparation is essential: If you do go to the Appeals Office, be prepared to discuss all issues you don&#8217;t agree with at the conference.</p>
<p>You also might need to file a formal written protest or a small case request with the office named in the IRS letter you received.</p>
<p>And definitely be sure to file your protest within the time limit specified in the letter you received.</p>
<p>Specifically, Appeals isn&#8217;t interested in and won&#8217;t accept any objection you have based on moral, religious, political, constitutional, conscientious, or similar grounds.</p>
<ul>
<li>Let the pros handle it: Your tax adviser can file the written protest for you.</li>
</ul>
<p>He or she also can take care of the discussions or hearings without you if you decide you just don&#8217;t want to go it alone.</p>
<p>If you do opt to skip the Appeal Office meeting and send only your lawyer, CPA or EA to make your case, be sure you have completed a power of attorney form allowing your representative to receive and inspect confidential information.</p>
<ul>
<li>Beyond Appeals: The IRS says that going through the Office of Appeals process generally settles most tax disputes without expensive and time-consuming court trials.</li>
</ul>
<p>If, however, that&#8217;s not the case in your tax disagreement, you can take your protest to the judicial level. This includes appeals to the United States Tax Court, the United States Court of Federal Claims or your United States District Court.</p>
<p>In difficult times, many families have trouble meeting their commitments. If you’re worried about the IRS garnishing your wages, levying your bank account, or taking your home,</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-4151" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tax-problems_-1-300x158.png" alt="IRS desk, man with pen, SFS" width="392" height="207" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tax-problems_-1-300x158.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tax-problems_-1-768x404.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tax-problems_-1.png 1000w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tax-problems_-1-700x368.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 392px) 100vw, 392px" /> then reaching out to our firm and getting a free, no-obligation, confidential consultation on your tax problem may give you some peace of mind.  Jeffrey Schneider, EA, CTRS is a tax expert and can work with you to file your back taxes and get you tax compliant.

			<p>You may have heard on the radio, T.V., and online, that you can settle your tax bill for less than what you owe. But are these claims really true? And can you settle your tax debt without hurting yourself in the long run?</p>
<p>Some of the national tax resolution firms you hear advertising offer minimal service, take a look at their Google and Yelp Reviews. So, it&#8217;s essential to know who you can trust and educate yourself on what your options are available to resolve your tax problem.</p>
<p>SFS Tax Problem Solutions is a specialty tax resolution firm. We encourage all of our readers that are facing a tax problem or know someone that is to contact us for a complimentary consultation.</p>
<p>The truth is that it&#8217;s often way more complicated than these big companies claim to negotiate a settlement for less than you owe the IRS, but it is possible. You must first learn if you qualify for the program. The program is known as an &#8220;offer in compromise,&#8221; but settling is not necessarily a bad thing.</p>
<p>An &#8220;offer in compromise&#8221; is a negotiated settlement between the taxpayer and the IRS that is intended to help taxpayers who owe more than they can pay. In many cases, you can settle your entire tax bill for a fraction of what you owe, if you qualify. You can only qualify if you genuinely can&#8217;t afford to pay back taxes or if doing so would cause extreme hardship. (i.e., if you have become disabled).</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-3907 size-medium" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/104a-tax-form-300x216.png" alt="" width="300" height="216" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/104a-tax-form-300x216.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/104a-tax-form.png 548w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />You also must be current on all legally required income tax returns and any estimated tax payments that you are required to make if you are self-employed. Nor can you be filing for bankruptcy.</p>
<p>The IRS would prefer to take an offer in compromise than send you to collections and potentially get less money. Taking an offer in compromise will NOT affect your credit score. Having your offer in compromise accepted is a far better financial decision in the long run.</p>
<p>However, working out what offer to make on your own and learning the whole process can be extremely challenging. That&#8217;s like representing yourself in a court of law without a lawyer. Not smart. A better answer is to find a tax resolution specialist that can help you with the process to see if you qualify and determine what you will have to pay. A CTRS, Certified Tax Resolution Specialist tax resolution specialist will also be a licensed CPA, Enrolled Agent, or an Attorney.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of working with a qualified and local tax resolution firm is that you get protection from the overbearing IRS. Whereby you will sleep better at night knowing you&#8217;re on your way towards a permanent tax solution. Additionally, the tax resolution expert can head-off any impending garnishments of your paycheck or levies on your bank account.</p>
<p>Settling with the IRS is a good thing and is often the best answer to dealing with your back-tax bill and moving on with your life.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-3908 size-medium" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2019-taxpayer-roadmap-300x296.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="296" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2019-taxpayer-roadmap-300x296.jpg 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2019-taxpayer-roadmap.jpg 611w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />If you want an expert tax resolution professional who knows how to navigate the IRS maze, reach out to our firm, and we&#8217;ll schedule a no-obligation confidential consultation to explain your options to resolve your tax problem permanently.</p>

			<p>If you are under audit from the IRS or in receipt of a notice of additional tax due, the steps you take next could make all the difference. There is a strong temptation to ignore these communications, however, doing nothing will not make the IRS go away. Indeed, the longer you wait, the more dire the situation will become.</p>
<p>Every day you wait is one more day the IRS will tack on fees, penalties, and additional interest. Before you make the situation worse, it is time to face the problem head on, even if that means hiring a tax resolution professional.</p>
<p>There are plenty of reasons to consider a tax resolution professional, especially if you do not have the money to pay what you owe. You may also want to consult a tax resolution professional if you disagree with the determination, or if you are confused by what the IRS is claiming. If you find that hiring a tax resolution firm is the right move, here are some key things to look for.</p>
<p>As an expert Tax Resolution Firm ourselves, we encourage all readers facing a tax problem to contact us for a free consultation either by phone at 877-355-8010 or email Marissa our office manager at <a href="mailto:marissa@sfstaxacct.com">marissa@sfstaxacct.com</a></p>
<h2>Skilled and Qualified Professionals</h2>
<p>The quality of the professional you receive will be directly impacted by the knowledge of the individuals who work there. The best tax resolution companies go out of their way to hire real experts, including men and women who have spent time working for the IRS.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3898 size-full" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/handshake-sfs.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/handshake-sfs.jpg 1000w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/handshake-sfs-300x200.jpg 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/handshake-sfs-768x512.jpg 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/handshake-sfs-700x467.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>This insider knowledge is hard to beat, and it is one of the key things to look for when hiring a tax resolution professional. Look for employees who spent time in the trenches, working directly on tax law, auditing and other related fields.</p>
<p>Relevant Experience<br />
Deep experience is critical when hiring a tax resolution professional. The tax code is extremely complicated, and it gets longer with every year. Look for individuals with relevant experience in all aspects of tax law, from ferreting out fraud to defending taxpayers who have simply made honest mistakes.</p>
<p>Always ask about the expertise and experience of the people who work for the tax resolution firm. Things like the longevity of service, background, and training can be pivotal, and they could tip the scales in favor of one tax resolution professional over another.</p>
<h2>The Availability of Specialists</h2>
<p>Not all tax situations are the same. The small business owner who receives a surprise tax bill will have different needs, and different questions, than a single mom.</p>
<p>When hiring a tax resolution professional, it is important to look for specialists who can help with your unique situation. Interview the company representative carefully, placing special emphasis on what you are expecting and what you would consider a fair resolution with the IRS.</p>
<h2>Deep Knowledge of Tax Resolution</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3899 size-full" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/books-sfs.jpg" alt="" width="796" height="340" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/books-sfs.jpg 796w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/books-sfs-300x128.jpg 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/books-sfs-768x328.jpg 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/books-sfs-700x299.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 796px) 100vw, 796px" />The U.S. tax code is anything but static; the government is constantly making changes. Those changes can have a profound impact on how much employees pay in taxes, the size of the refunds they receive and if their deductions will be approved.</p>
<p>When hiring a tax resolution professional, look for deep knowledge of not just tax law, but the programs available to resolve your tax problem. Continuing education in tax resolution specifically is a big deal for tax resolution professionals, and it is something you should insist on when interviewing potential providers.</p>
<p>No one likes to deal with the IRS, and sometimes you need some help in doing so. Whether you receive an audit notice or find a tax bill in your mailbox, you need to take steps to protect yourself and your money. A tax resolution professional can negotiate with the IRS on your behalf, potentially saving you money and helping you avoid legal and financial penalties. Knowing what to look for in such a service can help you get the most for your money, so you can stay on the good side of the IRS.</p>
