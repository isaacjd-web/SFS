<p>Did you know, as a taxpayer, you have your own Bill of Rights? The IRS has adopted a Taxpayer Bill of Rights for all of their dealings with the IRS. Chapter 5 of <em>Now What? The IRS is Taking Everything I Own. Help!</em> goes over all ten and what they mean for you. We put together a little summary.</p>
<h2><strong>I. The Right to Be Informed</strong></h2>
<p>Taxpayers have the right to know what they need to do to comply with the tax laws. They are entitled to clear explanations of the law and IRS procedures in all tax forms.</p>
<h2><strong>II. The Right to Quality Service <img class="alignright wp-image-3640 " src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/The-Protection-and-Fundamental-Rights-You-Have-with-the-IRS-The-Taxpayer-Bill-of-Rights-sfs-sfstax-jeffrey-schneider-now-what-help-mailbox-us-mail-1.jpg" alt="" width="523" height="407" /></strong></h2>
<p>Taxpayers have the right to receive prompt, courteous, and professional assistance in their dealings with the IRS, to be spoken to in a way they can easily understand, to receive clear and easily understandable communications from the IRS, and to have a way to file complaints about inadequate service.</p>
<h2><strong>III. The Right to Pay No More than the Correct Amount of Tax</strong></h2>
<p>Taxpayers have the right to pay only the amount of tax legally due and to have the IRS apply all tax payments properly.</p>
<h2><strong>IV. The Right to Challenge the IRS’ Position and Be Heard</strong></h2>
<p>Taxpayers have the right to raise objections and provide additional documentation in response to formal IRS actions or proposed actions, to expect that the IRS will fairly consider their timely objections and documentation promptly and fairly, and to receive a response if the IRS does not agree with their position.</p>
<h2><strong>V. The Right to Appeal an IRS Decision in an Independent Forum</strong></h2>
<p>Taxpayers are entitled to a fair and impartial administrative appeal of most IRS decisions, including many penalties, and have the right to receive a written response regarding the Office of Appeals’ decision. Taxpayers generally have the right to take their cases to court.</p>
<h2><strong>VI. The Right to Finality</strong></h2>
<p>Taxpayers have the right to know the maximum amount of time they have to challenge the IRS’s position, as well as the maximum amount of time the IRS has to audit a particular tax year or collect a tax debt. Taxpayers have the right to know when the IRS has finished an audit.</p>
<h2><strong>VII. The Right to Privacy <img class="alignright wp-image-3641 " src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/The-Protection-and-Fundamental-Rights-You-Have-with-the-IRS-The-Taxpayer-Bill-of-Rights-sfs-sfstax-jeffrey-schneider-now-what-help-key-padlock.jpg" alt="The Protection and Fundamental Rights You Have with the IRS, The Taxpayer Bill of Rights, sfs, sfstax, jeffrey schneider, now what help, key, padlock" width="590" height="494" /></strong></h2>
<p>Taxpayers have the right to expect that any IRS inquiry, examination, or enforcement action will comply with the law, be no more intrusive than necessary, and will respect all due process rights. This includes search and seizure protections and a collection due process hearing where applicable.</p>
<h2><strong>VIII. The Right to Confidentiality</strong></h2>
<p>Taxpayers have the right to expect that any information that they provide to the IRS will not be disclosed unless authorized by the taxpayer or by law. Taxpayers have the right to expect the IRS to investigate and take appropriate action against its employees, return preparers, and others who wrongfully use or disclose taxpayer return information.</p>
<h2><strong>IX. The Right to Retain Representation</strong></h2>
<p>Taxpayers have the right to retain an authorized representative of their choice to represent them in their dealings with the IRS. Taxpayers have the right to be told that, if they cannot afford to hire a representative, they may be eligible for assistance from a Low-Income Taxpayer Clinic.</p>
<h2><strong>X. The Right to a Fair and Just Tax System</strong></h2>
<p>Taxpayers have the right to expect the tax system to consider facts and circumstances that might affect their underlying liabilities, ability to pay, or ability to provide information in a timely manner. Taxpayers have the right to receive assistance from the Taxpayer Advocate Service if they are experiencing financial difficulty or the IRS has not resolved their tax issues properly and in a timely manner through its normal channels.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>“Not everyone is qualified to be a captain of a ship. When you’re miles from land and things get dicey, you want an Admiral, not a weekend sailor. You need a professional who knows what he or she is doing.”</strong></p>
<p>If your case gets remanded back to appeals, there are two other credentialed professionals that can represent you: the Certified Public Accountant and the Enrolled Agent.</p>
<p>Most tax return preparers provide outstanding service, however, they have differing levels of skill, as well as continuing education requirements and expertise.</p>
<p>Preparers with<strong> unlimited</strong> representation rights can represent their clients on any matters – including audits, payment collection issues, and appeals.</p>
<p>Preparers with<strong> limited</strong> representation rights can only represent clients whose returns they have prepared and signed.</p>
<h2><strong>Credentialed Return Preparers</strong></h2>
<p>Tax return preparers with <strong>unlimited</strong> rights include professionals with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enrolled Agents: Licensed by the IRS. Must pass a three-part Special Enrollment Examination. This is a comprehensive exam that requires them to demonstrate proficiency in federal tax planning, individual and business tax return preparation, and representation.</li>
<li>Attorneys: Licensed by state courts. Attorneys have earned a degree in law and have passed a bar exam. They may offer a range of services, and some specialize in tax preparation and planning.</li>
<li>Certified Public Accountants: Licensed by state courts. CPAs have passed the Uniform CPA Examination. They have completed a study of accounting at a college or university. They may offer a range of services, and some specialize in tax preparation and planning.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><img class="alignright wp-image-3539" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/The-Taxpayer-Representative-woman-sitting-desk-journal-note-taking-now-what-help-sfs-tax.jpg" alt="The Taxpayer Representative, woman, sitting, desk, journal, note taking, now what help, sfs tax" width="517" height="363" /></strong>If you are dealing with an audit, you cannot just walk into any tax return preparers’ office. Only an Enrolled Agent, a CPA, or an attorney can help you with an IRS issue.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>“Ask what those initials mean in the big scheme toward solving your problem. After all, you’ll be on the boat together and entrusting him or her with your financial life. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>You deserve to be certain you have the right one before you turn over the controls.” </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Where to Research for Preparers</strong></h2>
<p>The IRS has a searchable, sortable public directory at <a href="https://irs.treasury.gov/rpo/rpo.jsf">https://irs.treasury.gov/rpo/rpo.jsf</a> to search for various tax preparers.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Forget 10,000 Leagues Under the Sea. You’ll have to dive much deeper than that to get to the heart of the IRS.</strong></h2>
<p>When it comes to the administration and enforcement of our tax system, there are four basic levels:</p>
<h2><strong><img class="wp-image-3636 size-full alignright" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Chapter-Meme-B-1.jpg" alt="" width="526" height="526" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Chapter-Meme-B-1.jpg 526w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Chapter-Meme-B-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Chapter-Meme-B-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Chapter-Meme-B-1-500x500.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px" /></strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Examinations (Audits)</li>
<li>Collections</li>
<li>Appeals</li>
<li>Criminal Investigations</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s time to talk about the first three.</p>
<h2><strong>Examinations (Audits) </strong></h2>
<p>When a return is filed and processed, it is automatically deemed correct unless the IRS computers find an error.</p>
<h3><strong>What types of errors are picked up by the computers?</strong></h3>
<p>If you understate the income reported, overreport expenses, or report you had health insurance when you did not, the computer spits out a notice showing what they have compared to what you’ve put on your return.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you’ll get selected for audit (done locally or by mail). The auditor can pick up on these same errors or omissions.</p>
<h2><strong>Collections</strong></h2>
<p>The Internal Revenue Service is the world’s largest and most aggressive collection agency. Even with their funding woes, they can and will come after you (either in person or by mail <a href="https://sfstaxacct.com/2019/04/2019-dirty-dozen-list-of-tax-scams/">– never a phone call or email.</a>)</p>
<h2><strong><img class="alignright wp-image-3638 " src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/You-Have-It-We-Want-It-sfs-now-what-help-courtroom-courthouse-outside-2.jpg" alt="" width="427" height="645" /></strong></h2>
<p>One of the IRS collection units is the Automated Collections Service, or ACS. They have various service centers around the country. Then, there are Settlement Officers. These officials are usually in the IRS Appeals Office.</p>
<h2><strong>Appeals </strong></h2>
<p>A taxpayer usually gets one shot at appeals. The next step is to prepare and file a tax court petition. Generally, you can file this once you receive a 90-day notice (Statutory Notice of Deficiency.) You can prepare the petition:</p>
<ul>
<li>yourself</li>
<li>by a U.S. Tax Court Practitioner</li>
<li>by an attorney licensed to practice in your state</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, there is a $60 fee. You will wait until your petition gets on the court docket. Then, it is assigned to an IRS lawyer. Most of the time, IRS attorneys will “send it back to appeals,” because most cases are not USTC worthy (i.e. not enough money).</p>
<p>If you do not want to go to court (it is not cheap unless you do it yourself, and that is not highly recommended) and you cannot/do not pay, that is the crux of this book.</p>
<p>Just as you have the right to appeal an IRS decision, you also have the right to be represented.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Getting any notice from the IRS can send you into a tailspin. The feeling of dread starts when you see the return address on the envelope. First things first… sit down and take a deep breath! After that initial wave of panic subsides, it’s a good idea to open the notice and see what the IRS is sending you.</p>
<p>You may feel better knowing that the IRS sends millions of notices each year (by their own admission). Most of them are also generated automatically. So there’s no reason to be scared out of your wits.</p>
<p>You will get through this!</p>
<p><strong>How Do I Know I Got a CP2000 Notice? </strong></p>
<p>In the upper right-hand corner on the first page of the notice, it will tell you that it is a CP2000.</p>
<p>What is a CP2000 Notice?</p>
<p>Scary envelope aside, it is not a bill for taxes due, no matter how it looks at first glance. That’s the good news.</p>
<p>If you receive a CP2000 notice, it basically means that there is a mismatch. The income information that the IRS has on file doesn’t match what was reported on the tax return. The IRS assumes what they have is correct, so they are sending you this notice.</p>
<p>This can change the amount of tax you owe: You may owe more tax or that you may be entitled to a refund.</p>
<h3><strong>Why are You Getting a CP2000 Notice? </strong></h3>
<p>Each year, businesses and institutions send information to the IRS.</p>
<p>Employers have to send you a W-2, which reports taxable wages paid to you. Business owners must also file a Form-1099-MISC to each person they have collected at least $600 in rents, services, prizes and other income.</p>
<p>So if you have been paid any of these, the IRS already knows it… before you file your return.</p>
<p>The deadline for businesses to send these forms to you is the end of January. Using your social security number, the IRS matches that information with what you report on your tax return.</p>
<p>One of the most common reasons for receiving a CP2000 is omitting an amount from a 1099 when reporting your income. This can be side income, rental income, or even interest or dividends.</p>
<h3><strong>The CP2000 Notice: Presumed Correct</strong></h3>
<p>What the IRS receives from businesses takes a higher precedence than your tax return. Therefore, when you receive this notice, it will show you what your new tax is, based on the information received from all of these businesses.</p>

<h3><strong>So Now What? </strong></h3>
<p>You have two options. You can either pay the new amount as indicated on the notice, or you can dispute it.</p>
<h3><strong>If You Choose to Dispute the CP2000 Notice </strong></h3>
<p>If you disagree with the IRS finding, or if you can’t pay the amount they are asking for, an Enrolled Agent will navigate through the process on your behalf.</p>
<p>If you do owe the tax, interest, and penalties will be assessed on the balance due, which can make it harder to pay off all at once.</p>
<p>Depending on the amount of tax, the penalty amount can really add up. However, there are ways to have that penalty removed or abated. An EA is the best choice if you are interested in fighting those penalties.</p>
<p>Don’t lose sleep over receiving a CP2000 notice. You do need to take action, however. Call our office today to set an appointment or book one online now.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Debt can be a dark cloud that hangs over everything you do. When it comes to taxes, it’s that much worse. The more you ignore a tax debt, the bigger the debt gets, as penalties and interest are added on. Not only that, the IRS has the power to assess <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_lien">tax liens</a> against your personal property and even levy your bank account or garnish your wages.</p>
<p>If this is you… take heart!</p>
<h3><strong>You Can Make a Fresh Start </strong></h3>
<p>The IRS has a Fresh Start program that launched 10 years ago in the midst of a biting economic recession. Designed to make paying your back taxes and avoiding tax liens easier, it has been expanded over the years. The program has helped people around the country get back on their feet.</p>
<p>Knowing exactly where you stand makes it easier to come to a resolution that will satisfy the IRS and allow you to move on with your life…minus one dark cloud. We recommend retaining a professional in dealing with these issues.</p>
<h3><strong>Greater Access to Installment Agreements </strong></h3>
<p>Sometimes you can’t pay what you owe all at once. The IRS offers installment agreements for this purpose.</p>
<p>What if you can’t pay the monthly amount the IRS wants?</p>
<p>Don’t despair.</p>
<p>There are options.</p>
<h3><strong>IRS Tax Liens Minimum Raised</strong></h3>
<p>The program increased to $10,000 the amount you must owe before a tax lien can be filed. The IRS may still file a tax lien notice for an amount less than the $10,000 at its discretion, however.</p>
<p>One important feature of the Fresh Start program is that the tax lien may be withdrawn if you meet certain conditions, including paying off your tax debt.  You may also qualify if you are paying your debt through a Direct Debit installment agreement.</p>
<p>However, if you then default on your installment agreement the IRS can file another tax lien.</p>
<h3><strong>Greater Flexibility when Considering Offers in Compromise</strong></h3>
<p>The IRS will analyze your ability to pay when considering whether to agree to allow you to settle your tax debt for less than the full amount. The Fresh Start program gave the IRS more flexibility when analyzing that ability.</p>
<p>If they believe you can pay in full within a reasonable amount of time, it will probably not be accepted. The IRS looks at your income, assets, and other factors in determining your ability to pay.</p>
<p>Did we make it sound easy? It’s not. It’s a lot of work and it takes time for the taxpayer and their representative. Don’t do this alone.</p>
