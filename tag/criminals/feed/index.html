<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>More Recent Tax Cases You’ll Enjoy Reading About (Tax Fraud)</strong></h1>
<p>If you liked our <a href="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/tax-cases/">last</a> stories, these will blow you away.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-2668" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/More-Recent-Tax-Cases-You’ll-Enjoy-Reading-About-Tax-Fraud-Shirley-New-York-NYC.jpg" alt="More Recent Tax Cases You’ll Enjoy Reading About (Tax Fraud), Shirley, New York, NYC" width="282" height="222" /></p>
<h3><strong>Shirley, N.Y.</strong></h3>
<p>In our first short story, we’ll introduce Fred Towle Jr., 52. Towle pleaded guilty to endorsing a false return for 2012 that underreported his business income.</p>
<p>Towle owned the company East Coast Marketing. He used this company to consult with political candidates and assist homeowners for his own gain. Furthermore, he was expediting approvals for permits from various governmental entities in Suffolk County, N.Y.</p>
<p>Towle’s fraudulent activity began in 2012. He falsely reported no taxable income from businesses controlled by him, including East Coast Marketing. Knowing that he was earning approximately $246,000 in taxable corporate income for that year, he still claimed nothing.<br />
Between tax years 2012 and 2014, Towle failed to declare approximately $1.2 million in income; this resulted in a tax loss to the U.S. of some $307,427.</p>
<p>Towle faces a maximum of three years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. His plea included an agreement to pay $307,427 in restitution, which was the full amount of his tax liabilities.</p>
<h3><strong>Hamden, Conn. <img class="alignright  wp-image-2669" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/More-Recent-Tax-Cases-You’ll-Enjoy-Reading-About-Tax-Fraud-Hamden-Connecticut-CT.jpg" alt="More Recent Tax Cases You’ll Enjoy Reading About (Tax Fraud), Hamden, Connecticut, CT" width="361" height="240" /></strong></h3>
<p>Next, we have Ira Malkin, 49. This salesman is guilty of tax evasion, and was sentenced six months in prison. He also has three years of supervised release.</p>
<p>Malkin worked as a principal salesman for Good Copy Printing Center Inc., New Haven -according to court documents and statements in court. He earned substantial commissions and GCP paid many of Malkin’s personal expenses.</p>
<p>With Malkin’s consent, GCP reduced his commissions by the amount of personal expenses the company paid. He then reported to the IRS that Malkin had earned substantially less income than he truly earned.</p>
<p>In a second scenario, GCP handled printing jobs for Comcast. GCP mailed flyers and paid the postage with the expectation that the company would be reimbursed for that expense. Malkin had GCP pay the postage for the Comcast mailings and made Comcast reimburse him for the cost of the mailings. GCP reduced his earned commissions by the amount of postage paid by GCP. Through this arrangement, between approximately 2009 and 2012 GCP further under-reported Malkin’s income on filed W-2s.</p>
<p>Through this scheme, Malkin underreported more than $1.5 million in income. He skipped out on $484,581 in federal income taxes! Even though he pleaded guilty in February and paid all of his back taxes, Malkin still owes the IRS more than $700,000 in interest and penalties.</p>
<p>During his supervised release, he must spend six months in home confinement and perform 200 hours of community service.</p>

<p>Preparer Janet Benitez, 44, who prepared returns for illegal aliens and concealed her own income, pleaded guilty to filing a false income tax return, according to published reports.</p>
<p>During the course of 5 years, Benitez reportedly submitted returns on behalf of 23 illegal aliens seeking fraudulent refunds of at least $123,999. She not only failed to report her prep fees for tax years 2011 through 2015, but she filed false income tax returns in her name and her spouse’s name when she should have filed one return that combined their income. However, this would have resulted in tax due… apparently a cost she didn’t want to pay.</p>
<p>She has reportedly agreed to pay $265,839 in restitution to the IRS.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Filing a false income tax return carries a maximum of three years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.</p>
<h3><strong>Peabody, Mass. <img class="alignright  wp-image-2671" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/More-Recent-Tax-Cases-You’ll-Enjoy-Reading-About-Tax-Fraud-Peabody-Massachusetts-MA.jpg" alt="More Recent Tax Cases You’ll Enjoy Reading About (Tax Fraud), Peabody, Massachusetts, MA" width="339" height="240" /></strong></h3>
<p>William Panousos, 67; his wife, Theodora, 65; and their son, Konstantinos, 39 were taken down as family. These current and former owners of Giovanni’s Roast Beef &amp; Pizza have been sentenced in connection with skimming cash receipts from Giovanni’s and failing to report the cash on their tax returns. They avoided payment of some $550,000 in taxes.</p>
<p>The family each received three years’ probation, with the first 18 months confined to the City of Peabody. Next, they were ordered to pay a fine of $150,000. They were also ordered to pay restitution of $549,883 to the IRS.</p>
<p>In November, all three pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud the U.S. William Panousos also pleaded guilty to three counts of aiding and assisting in filing false corporate and individual returns. Theodora pleaded guilty to four counts and Konstantinos to two.</p>
<p>During tax years 2013 through 2015, the Panousoses skimmed some $2.8 million in cash receipts from Giovanni’s and did not deposit them into the business’ bank account or report them to their preparer. They diverted about $1.5 million of those cash receipts to their own personal use. They used the rest of the skimmed cash to pay some of their business expenses, including a portion of payments to suppliers and a portion of employees’ salaries. In addition, the defendants failed to report those cash expenses on their returns.</p>

<p>Farmer Kurt Neldeberg, 65, filed false and fraudulent returns and has been sentenced to two years’ probation.</p>
<p>Neldeberg pleaded guilty in February. He admitted that from at least 2009 through 2012, he failed to report some $315,512 in income from grain sales. This resulted in more than $100,000 in unpaid taxes due and owing.</p>
<p>He admitted that he deposited proceeds from farm grain sales into personal bank accounts and failed to inform his bookkeeper and his preparer that he had done so. His farm receipts on Schedule F of his joint federal returns resulted in under-reported income for each of the tax years 2009 through 2012.</p>
<p>Neldeberg was also ordered to complete 120 hours of community service, to pay a $100 special assessment and to make full restitution to the IRS. Neldeberg previously posted a $125,000 cash bond to the IRS for restitution.</p>
<h3><strong>St. Louis<img class="alignright  wp-image-2674" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/More-Recent-Tax-Cases-You’ll-Enjoy-Reading-About-Tax-Fraud-St-Louis-Missouri-MO.jpg" alt="More Recent Tax Cases You’ll Enjoy Reading About (Tax Fraud), St Louis, Missouri, MO" width="352" height="197" /> </strong></h3>
<p>Prep-service operator Asmerom “Ace” Keleta, 33, has been sentenced to five years in prison for conspiring to defraud the U.S. through tax fraud and for preparing fraudulent returns.</p>
<p>According to court documents, Keleta operated University City Tax Service starting in 2012. He conspired with employees Miyoshi Lewis and Teklom Paulos to prepare fraudulent returns for clients. Keleta directed the employees to inflate refunds by listing false American Opportunity Credits and federal fuel tax credits. He also created false Schedule C income to fraudulently maximize Earned Income Tax Credits.</p>
<p>Keleta also prepared false returns for clients and, as owner of University City Tax, received a percentage of clients’ inflated refunds.</p>
<p>He was also ordered to pay $662,645 in restitution.</p>

<h3><strong>Atlanta</strong></h3>
<p>A federal court has barred preparer Marjorie St. Jean and MarjorieStjeanLLC from preparing federal returns for others and owning or operating a prep business.</p>
<p>The court also ordered that St. Jean and MarjorieStjeanLLC pay $367,346.14, representing the gains for the preparation of returns making false claims.</p>
<p>St. Jean and MarjorieStjeanLLC, an entity through which she operates prep stores, prepared returns that included fraudulent claims for the EITC, often based on bogus dependents, fabricated business income and expenses or false filing statuses. The court also determined that MarjorieStjeanLLC often prepared returns that falsely claimed fuel tax credits, household help income, unreimbursed employee business expenses and self-employment income or expenses.</p>

<h4><strong>Cincinnati<img class="alignright  wp-image-2455" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/7-Recent-Tax-Cases-You’ll-Enjoy-Reading-About-close-up-court-courthouse-hammer.jpg" alt="7 Recent Tax Cases You’ll Enjoy Reading About, close up, court, courthouse, hammer" width="369" height="191" /> </strong></h4>
<p>Demolition executive Hugo Santamaria has been sentenced to two years in prison for tax and structuring crimes.</p>
<p>According to case documents and information, Santamaria pleaded guilty in August 2017 to structuring cash transactions to avoid currency transaction reports and conspiring to defraud the U.S. Beginning in 2006, Santamaria owned and operated multiple demolition companies and conspired with his business partner in those companies to conceal income from the IRS and evade personal income taxes.</p>
<p>He engaged in such acts of evasion as opening bank accounts for his co-conspirator to hide income and serving as a nominee for his co-conspirator’s businesses. Santamaria also wrote, signed and cashed numerous checks and made cash withdrawals in amounts less than $10,000 on consecutive days. He and his co-conspirator also paid workers in cash and failed to withhold and pay over any payroll taxes.</p>
<p>Santamaria admitted to paying himself a weekly salary from company bank accounts. He also admitted a number of crimes, including paying personal expenses with the business bank accounts. This includes food, lodging, clothing, gym memberships and tuition for private school. Simultaneously, he has not filed a personal tax return since 2007.</p>
<h6>The Sentencing</h6>
<p>They ordered Santamaria three years of supervised release and to pay $26,213 in restitution to the IRS.</p>
<h4><strong>Amherst, N.Y.</strong></h4>
<p>Realtor Maxim Levin, 40, has pleaded guilty to filing a false tax return.</p>
<p>From 2012 to 2015, Levin operated Glebova Realty Group. This group purchased, renovated and sold real estate throughout the Buffalo, N.Y., area. During those years, Levin did file federal income tax returns. However, he failed to accurately report the gross receipts that he earned from his real estate business to the IRS. As you might assume, he also failed to pay taxes on such income. He caused more than $3.1 million of gross receipts from his real estate business to be excluded from his returns. This resulted in a tax loss of $161,606.</p>
<h6>The Sentencing</h6>
<p>The charge carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a $250,000 fine.</p>
<h4><strong>Waialua, Hawaii</strong></h4>
<p>The court convicted Preparer Guillermo Dahilig of aiding and assisting in the preparation and filing of false returns. The court sentenced him 18 months in prison. <img class="alignright  wp-image-2456" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/7-Recent-Tax-Cases-You’ll-Enjoy-Reading-About-cars-crowd-daylight.jpg" alt="7 Recent Tax Cases You’ll Enjoy Reading About, cars, crowd, daylight" width="263" height="249" /></p>
<p>According to court documents and case information, from 2009 to 2016 Dahilig owned and operated Speedy Gill Services, an Oahu tax prep business. He prepared 750 to 1,000 returns per year for clients and charged $100 to $200 per return. To inflate refunds, he falsified clients’ returns with deductions for items such as medical expenses, personal property tax, job expenses and charitable contributions that he knew were greater than the figures provided by his clients. From at least 2010 through 2013, he also underreported the income of Speedy Gill on the returns he prepared and filed for himself and his wife.</p>
<p>Following his incarceration, Dahilig will be on supervised release for a year. They&#8217;ve also ordered him to pay $318,222 in restitution to the IRS.</p>
<h4><strong>New York </strong></h4>
<p>CPA and attorney Steven Etkind has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the U.S. and tax evasion arising from a scheme to embezzle millions from a deceased client’s estate.</p>
<p>According to court documents and statements in court, Etkind was a partner at a New York law firm’s tax, trusts and estates group. He performed legal work for a successful entrepreneur client. The client then died in 2008, naming Etkind as the co-executor of his $35 million estate.</p>
<p>The client’s will directed the creation of two charitable trust private foundations, funded with assets from the client’s estate, for the sole purpose of donating to 501(c)(3) organizations, including those aimed at assisting Jewish-sponsored organizations. Etkind was the co-trustee of these trusts.</p>
<h6>The Background</h6>
<p>Beginning in 2009, Etkind and his co-conspirator set up a phony charitable organization, the United Jewish Education Foundation, and used it to steal more than $3.5 million from these charitable trusts. Then, Etkind directed that donations from the trusts be first made to legitimate Jewish charitable organizations to give the disbursements the appearance of legitimate donations. The criminal and his co-conspirator then redirected the funds to accounts of the UJEF, the phony charity that his co-conspirator controlled.</p>
<p>Etkind subsequently directed his co-conspirator to write checks, totaling $327,500, to a bank account in the name of JE Capital Holding Corp., a nominee corporate entity that Etkind controlled exclusively. He further directed more than $3 million to be used in 2010 to purchase a 6,300 square-foot home with a swimming pool in Southampton, N.Y. Etkind later transferred title of the property to JE Trust, a nominee trust he controlled.</p>
<p>Etkind filed and caused to be filed fraudulent personal, corporate and charitable trust returns with the IRS. This was solely to conceal his embezzlement. During a subsequent IRS audit of UJEF, Etkind and his co-conspirator made several false and misleading statements, including about the true ownership of the Southampton property.</p>
<h6>The Sentencing</h6>
<p>Sentencing is Jan. 18. Etkind faces a maximum of five years in prison on the conspiracy charge and five years for tax evasion. He also faces a period of supervised release, restitution, and monetary penalties.</p>
<h4><strong>Ft. Myers, Fla.</strong></h4>
<p>Resident Attila Kalmar has been sentenced to 18 months in prison. Get this: he was stealing government funds and endeavoring to obstruct internal revenue laws. According to court documents, Kalmar filed 2007 through 2009 trust returns with the IRS in the name of First AK-Open Sec Trust, a nominee entity, seeking more than $480,000 in fraudulent refunds. He deposited a refund check he received as a result of these filings into a bank account. Afterward, he used the proceeds to purchase real property, acquire thousands of dollars in gold coins and wire money overseas.</p>
<p>He tried to impede the internal revenue laws by transferring funds between nominee bank accounts. Also, he falsely represented to the IRS that an IRS revenue officer was the trustee for First AK-Open Sec Trust.</p>
<h6>The Sentencing</h6>
<p>In addition to the term of prison imposed, the courts ordered Kalmar to serve three years of supervised release. He forfeited $274,019, a piece of real estate to the U.S. and paid $274,019 in restitution to the IRS.</p>
