<p>Gucci doesn’t seem to be doing so well lately. One of the most world-renowned Italian fashion brands has been dealing with some pretty heavy stuff, from the Blackface Jumper to their back taxes crisis.</p>
<h2><strong>A Major Fashion Mistake </strong></h2>
<p>Gucci had to pull a controversial jumper from its stores and website after becoming embroiled in a blackface racism row. An image of its women’s “balaclava jumper” received tons of backlash after being shared on social media. It was a black top that features neck with a mouth cut-out outlined in red.</p>
<p>Gucci has since issued an apology “for the offense caused” and has removed the item from its stores and online.</p>
<p>However, the £688 jumper is still available for purchase on the shopping website Spring. It is captioned as being part of the “The Fall Winter 2018 runway show” and was “inspired by vintage ski masks”.</p>
<h2><strong>Back Taxes Crisis</strong></h2>
<p>If that isn’t enough to deal with, Kering SA, the French owner of the Gucci luxury brand received a government audit. As it turns out, Gucci owes $1.6 billion ($1.4 Euros) to Italy in back taxes. Both Gucci’s chief executive Marco Bizzarri and former chief executive Patrizio Di Marco are under investigation currently.</p>
<p>The probe scrutinized business activities by Kering’s Swiss subsidiary, Luxury Goods International, from 2011 through 2017, according to a company statement. Kering said it contests the findings of the Italian audit. <img class="alignright wp-image-3680 " src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Gucci-Brand-in-Crisis-Mode-with-Back-Taxes-and-Racist-Mistake-1.jpg" alt="Gucci Brand in Crisis Mode with Back Taxes and Racist Mistake, gucci store, store, italy" width="435" height="380" /></p>
<p>While the initial liability is in the expected range and “should not shock,” the company might face additional fines, John Guy, an analyst with Mainfirst Bank, said in a note. The company “has been provisioning ahead for the liability and will be able to offset part of the claim, hence we expect a lower net number.”</p>
<p>The auditor’s report will be reviewed by Italy’s revenue agency. Then a final conclusion will be made, according to the statement. Kering said it doesn’t have the necessary information to make a specific accounting provision for the tax exposure. It has implemented strict monitoring of its tax risks.</p>
<p>French news site Mediapart had reported that the company billed for business carried out in other countries at a Swiss logistics center. As a result, it paid lower tax rates than it would have in Italy.</p>

<p>Snipes continues to getting knocked down by the IRS. Rather than give up, he too keeps getting back in the ring. In his latest skirmish with the service, the Tax Court held that the IRS did not abuse its discretion by refusing to accept his offer in compromise.</p>
<p>Snipes’ problems began with federal tax liabilities of $23.5 million from 2001-2006. This was partially a result of his failure to file tax returns. The IRS assessed those liabilities, and filed a notice of federal tax lien. It then issued a notice and demand for payment of the liabilities.</p>

<p>Wesley Snipes must know a little how Carmen Basilio felt.</p>
<p>Basilio, the “Upstate Onion Farmer” from Canastota, N.Y., was a world champion boxer in both the Welterweight and Middleweight divisions during the 1950s. Unfortunately, he was knocked down repeatedly in one match that he was sure to lose. When asked afterward why he kept getting up despite having no chance, he reportedly said “I don’t want to start any bad habits.”</p>
<p>Snipes continues to getting knocked down by the IRS. Rather than give up, he too keeps getting back in the ring. In his latest skirmish with the service, the Tax Court held that the IRS did not abuse its discretion by refusing to accept his offer in compromise.</p>
<p>Snipes’ problems began with federal tax liabilities of $23.5 million from 2001-2006. This was partially a result of his failure to file tax returns. The IRS assessed those liabilities, and filed a notice of federal tax lien. It then issued a notice and demand for payment of the liabilities. <img class="alignright wp-image-2540" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Wesley-Snipes-Continuously-Fights-the-IRS-carmen-basilio-fighting-getting-medical-assistance.jpg" alt="Wesley Snipes Continuously Fights the IRS, carmen, basilio, fighting, getting medical assistance" width="485" height="281" /></p>
<h3><strong>The Proceedings</strong></h3>
<p>When Snipes did not pay, the IRS issued a notice of the filing. Snipes requested a collection due process hearing and stated that he wanted a collection alternative – an offer in compromise or “currently not collectible” status – and wanted the notice of federal tax lien withdrawn.</p>
<p>Snipes did not challenge his underlying tax liabilities. He made a cash offer of $842,061, less than 4 percent of the total underlying liability. The IRS issued a notice of determination rejecting his OIC and sustaining the notice of federal tax lien. Snipes filed a petition with the Tax Court.</p>
<p>Snipes contended during both CDP proceedings that his financial adviser, W. Johnson, had taken out loans and disposed of assets and income on his behalf, diverting the funds without his knowledge or benefit. He provided affidavits from Johnson of his misconduct and misuse of his assets and income, but did not provide any definitive documentation showing the dissipation or diversion of his assets or income.</p>
<p>Snipes requested that the IRS conduct a transferee investigation of Johnson, and that they accept his offer with the condition of proving Johnson’s transferee liability. The settlement officer requested permission from her manager to conduct an expedited transferee investigation, but the manager explained that the CDP hearing could not be held open for a transferee investigation, nor could the IRS accept an OIC with conditions imposed on it.</p>
<h3><strong>One of Many Verdicts</strong></h3>
<p>Following a review of Snipe’s case, the settlement officer an effort to compromise for settlement purposes. She reduced Snipes’ “reasonable collection potential” to $9,581,027. Snipes maintained his original OIC of $842,061. The settlement officer concluded that it was not in the best interest of the government to accept the OIC. She issued Snipes a supplemental notice sustaining the notice of federal tax lien, and again rejecting Snipes’ OIC.</p>
<p>The Tax Court noted that the validity of Snipes’ underlying tax liabilities was not at issue. The court concluded that the settlement officer properly based her determination on the required factors. They determined that she did not abuse her discretion in determining that acceptance of the OIC was not in the best interests of the United States.</p>
<p>The Tax Court held that in light of Snipes’ failure to provide bona fide documentation to prove his assets and financial condition, as well as the disparity in his offer versus his RCP as determined by the IRS, the settlement officer did not abuse her discretion in her rejection of Snipes’ offer, refusing to conduct an expedited transferee investigation, or sustaining the filing of the notice. <img class="alignright wp-image-2541" title="Wesley Snipes Continuously Fights the IRS, on tv" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Wesley-Snipes-Continuously-Fights-the-IRS-on-tv.jpg" alt="Wesley Snipes Continuously Fights the IRS, on tv" width="564" height="411" /></p>
<p>“The court was unable to determine whether or not he still owned the property. On a smaller scale, this is what happens all the time,” Davidoff noted. “And it’s not the end of the line for him.</p>
<h3><strong>What Happens Next: The Cycle</strong></h3>
<p>Now it will go back to Collections, and start all over again. In the meantime he has delayed the IRS, and the statute of limitations has been extended for five years. My guess is that he’s paid more than $100,000 to do this, but he has all the rights that any other taxpayer has in Collections. If they think some of his assets got transferred to Johnson, they might try to seize some of those assets.”</p>
<p>“It sounds like he has a lot of illiquid assets or assets that he can’t account for. If he’s correct in the valuation of his assets, then that’s all they can take – they can’t take more than he has,” Davidoff mentioned.</p>

Attempting to cut your tax liability by getting into IRS grey areas can cause you problems later on. You don&#8217;t have to do anything unethical to get your return pulled for an audit; you may just have raised too many red flags. Also, an audit can be done via letter, (i.e. <a href="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/now-what-i-got-a-cp2000-notice-help/">CP2000 Notice</a>) not just face-to-face. If you’re in the middle of an audit, or owe back taxes, contact Jeffrey Schneider, EA, CTRS to resolve your tax problem(s). Here are the top 10 red flags the IRS target that you want to avoid:</p>
<h3><strong>1. Making too much money</strong></h3>
<p>First, here&#8217;s a problem most of us would dream to have. Making over $200,000! You&#8217;re honestly more likely to be audited. The fact is that there are fewer auditors, so the IRS is focusing on where they can make the most bang for their buck.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Not reporting all of your income </strong></h3>
<p>No matter how much or little you make, you have to report everything. In some way or other, unless you run a strictly cash business, all of your income is reported to the IRS. W2, 1099 and other forms you receive are duplicated, then they are sent in to the IRS. If your reported income doesn&#8217;t match theirs, you will get a notice.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Math errors </strong></h3>
<p>Your information will be entered into a computer whether you file electronically or file a paper form. Remember, the one thing computers are very good at is doing math and if things don’t add up, or there was an honest mistake while inputting the information, it can raise a red flag. A math error won&#8217;t necessarily generate an audit, but it will get the attention you may not want. Make sure to double check your returns. Better yet, have a qualified tax professional assist you and keep you out of tax trouble.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Home businesses that never make money<img class="alignright wp-image-1933" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/How-to-Avoid-Being-Audited-cartoon-woman-shocked-thinking-i-thought-i-could-just-write-it-off.jpg" alt="How to Avoid Being Audited, cartoon woman, shocked, thinking, i thought i could just write it off" width="262" height="388" /></strong></h3>
<p>Sole proprietorships that file a Schedule C year after year and always show a loss will raise a red flag. You could even show a profit, but if the profit margin is always unreasonably small, then that will get the IRS&#8217; attention.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Large charitable deductions</strong></h3>
<p>There is nothing wrong with being charitable and there is no legal limit to how much of your hard earned cash you can give away. It is another red flag, however, if your donation is different than what’s considered the norm.</p>
<h3><strong>6. Overstating business expenses</strong></h3>
<p>Depending on the type of job you have, there can be many legitimate expenses that your employer doesn&#8217;t reimburse you for. Don&#8217;t be tempted to write off just a little extra if you have your own business. These might be genuine deductions you&#8217;re considering. However, you don&#8217;t want to deduct something that&#8217;s not on the approved list and don&#8217;t claim deductions way outside the norm. Check with your tax professional – or if you don’t have one, consider Jeffrey Schneider, EA, CTRS, NPTI Fellow &#8211; who is up to date with tax laws. You don’t want to be padding your tax return with write-offs.</p>
<h3><strong>7. Sketchy real estate rental revenue or losses</strong></h3>
<p>Some people will &#8216;rent&#8217; their property to friends or family at well below market value and then claim normal rental business expenses. As with other areas, the IRS compares what you claim against local standards to determine if this is a legit business. If not, they will disallow the deductions.</p>
<h3><strong>8. Home office deductions</strong></h3>
<p>There are absolutely legitimate home office deductions but the IRS has very strict guidelines on what you can claim and how much. Try to claim too much and this is a classic red flag.</p>
<h3><strong>9. Claiming losses for things that aren&#8217;t deductible or deductible in your circumstances </strong></h3>
<p>For example, claiming day-trading losses on a Schedule C. If you dabble in stock trading and take a loss, it may or may not be deductible, but almost certainly doesn&#8217;t qualify for a Schedule C loss. You also can&#8217;t take a deduction for alimony as a business expense. The IRS maintains a list of non-deductible expenses, make sure to check that and check with your tax professional.</p>

<h3><strong>10. Claiming 100% business use of your vehicle</strong></h3>
<p>If you spend most of the time in your vehicle doing your job, you may think it&#8217;s easier just to claim the whole amount as a business expense, but this is wrong. You will either have to show your personal use, no matter how small, or have to show you have a second vehicle for personal use.</p>
