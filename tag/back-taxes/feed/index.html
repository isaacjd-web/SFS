			<h4>2020, The Year You Deal With Your Back Taxes!</h4>
<p>Deal With Your Back Taxes. According to the IRS, more than 13.2 million Americans owe back taxes. The majority of these cases involve amounts that seem impossible to pay off.</p>
<p>That leaves those tax-owing folks in a difficult position. They want to pay, but they can&#8217;t, and the end result is feeling a lot of guilt about the situation.  There is no easy way to get out of paying your back taxes. Uncle Sam wants his money, and he&#8217;ll get it somehow.</p>
<p>There are steps you can take to find a solution and make 2020 the year you finally deal with your taxes.</p>
<p>Note, we always recommend getting in touch with a Certified Tax Resolution Specialist to negotiate with the IRS on your behalf. If you’d like to schedule a no-cost confidential tax relief consultation, contact us here. <a href="https://meetme.so/SFSTax"><strong>https://meetme.so/SFSTax</strong></a> or call 877.355.8010</p>
<h4><strong>Why Now Is the Right Time to Deal with Back Taxes</strong><strong><img class="alignright wp-image-4308" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Now-Is-the-Right-Time-to-Deal-with-Back-Taxes-1-300x158.png" alt="Deal With Your Back Taxes-finances-hpuse-sfstaxproblemsolutions" width="372" height="196" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Now-Is-the-Right-Time-to-Deal-with-Back-Taxes-1-300x158.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Now-Is-the-Right-Time-to-Deal-with-Back-Taxes-1-768x404.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Now-Is-the-Right-Time-to-Deal-with-Back-Taxes-1.png 1000w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Now-Is-the-Right-Time-to-Deal-with-Back-Taxes-1-700x368.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 372px) 100vw, 372px" /></strong></h4>
<p><strong>#1 You&#8217;ll End Up Owing Less</strong></p>
<p>The longer you wait to pay your back taxes, the more you are going to end up owing. That&#8217;s because the IRS can and will add penalties that can add up quickly.   The longer you drag out the situation, the more you&#8217;ll need to pay your tax resolution specialist to help you handle everything. The sooner you act, the sooner you can resolve the issue and the less you&#8217;ll have to pay.</p>
<p>If you need help from a CPA, Enrolled Agent or a lawyer who is also a tax resolution professional, look for someone that will charge you a flat fee rather than an hourly rate. Some cases take longer to resolve, so it’s important to know up front what you’ll be paying in service fees to get your back-tax issue resolved.</p>
<p><strong>#2 Housing prices are at an all-time high. Time to cash in?</strong></p>
<p>If you own your home or have equity in it, selling it and downsizing may be the best way to settle your tax debt and get a clean slate. Now is a perfect time, too, with housing prices at a premium in many areas of the country. You can use that cash in the bank to settle your back taxes almost immediately. Additionally, if your home is worth more than you owe, you can then reinvest that money or save it for a rainy day. That gives you a clean financial slate to start rebuilding your life.</p>
<p><strong>#3 Economic Uncertainty</strong></p>
<p>Most experts agree we’re due for a recession soon. How soon? Well, no one knows. What we do know is that having a large back tax bill will only hinder your ability to weather a storm in the event of an economic downturn.</p>
<p>You might be able to take a low interest loan out now that the economy is still good and settle your tax bill. Taking care of your taxes while the economy is still good will give you peace of mind and breathing room in case things go south with the economy.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Massachusetts Couple Could Face Long Prison Term</strong></h1>
<p>Gary DeCicco and Pamela Avedisian of Nahant, MA, were charged with multiple felonies. We&#8217;re talking two counts of tax evasion, one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud. They&#8217;ve also been charged with four counts of wire fraud and six counts of engaging in unlawful monetary transactions.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-3647 " src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Massachusetts-Couple-Could-Face-Long-Prison-Term-hands-handcuffs-white-wall-1.jpg" alt="" width="590" height="385" /></p>
<p>Between April 2012 and February 2013, DeCicco told the IRS that he did not have the ability to pay his more than $340,000 tax liability.  He repeatedly claimed he had very little cash, no vehicles or real properties during that time.</p>
<p>According to the IRS, he had ownership of several businesses, vehicles and real estate, titled to other entities to conceal his ownership from the IRS.</p>
<p>Originally, the IRS accepted a monthly installment plan based on false information.  During that time, DeCicco allegedly bought and sold numerous real properties, boats, luxury cars, concealing the sales with the help of Avedisian.</p>
<h2><strong>The Results of Their Fraud</strong></h2>
<p>The couple could face up to 5 years in prison for each count of tax evasion, up to 30 years for wire fraud and conspiracy to commit bank fraud, and up to 20 years for unlawful monetary transactions consecutively, as well as supervised release and monetary fines and penalties.</p>

<p>Gucci doesn’t seem to be doing so well lately. One of the most world-renowned Italian fashion brands has been dealing with some pretty heavy stuff, from the Blackface Jumper to their back taxes crisis.</p>
<h2><strong>A Major Fashion Mistake </strong></h2>
<p>Gucci had to pull a controversial jumper from its stores and website after becoming embroiled in a blackface racism row. An image of its women’s “balaclava jumper” received tons of backlash after being shared on social media. It was a black top that features neck with a mouth cut-out outlined in red.</p>
<p>Gucci has since issued an apology “for the offense caused” and has removed the item from its stores and online.</p>
<p>However, the £688 jumper is still available for purchase on the shopping website Spring. It is captioned as being part of the “The Fall Winter 2018 runway show” and was “inspired by vintage ski masks”.</p>
<h2><strong>Back Taxes Crisis</strong></h2>
<p>If that isn’t enough to deal with, Kering SA, the French owner of the Gucci luxury brand received a government audit. As it turns out, Gucci owes $1.6 billion ($1.4 Euros) to Italy in back taxes. Both Gucci’s chief executive Marco Bizzarri and former chief executive Patrizio Di Marco are under investigation currently.</p>
<p>The probe scrutinized business activities by Kering’s Swiss subsidiary, Luxury Goods International, from 2011 through 2017, according to a company statement. Kering said it contests the findings of the Italian audit. <img class="alignright wp-image-3680 " src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Gucci-Brand-in-Crisis-Mode-with-Back-Taxes-and-Racist-Mistake-1.jpg" alt="Gucci Brand in Crisis Mode with Back Taxes and Racist Mistake, gucci store, store, italy" width="435" height="380" /></p>
<p>While the initial liability is in the expected range and “should not shock,” the company might face additional fines, John Guy, an analyst with Mainfirst Bank, said in a note. The company “has been provisioning ahead for the liability and will be able to offset part of the claim, hence we expect a lower net number.”</p>
<p>The auditor’s report will be reviewed by Italy’s revenue agency. Then a final conclusion will be made, according to the statement. Kering said it doesn’t have the necessary information to make a specific accounting provision for the tax exposure. It has implemented strict monitoring of its tax risks.</p>
<p>French news site Mediapart had reported that the company billed for business carried out in other countries at a Swiss logistics center. As a result, it paid lower tax rates than it would have in Italy.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>$458 Owed in Back Taxes&#8230;The IRS Are On Their Way!</strong></h2>
<p>If you thought you were getting away from the IRS before… apparently so did everybody else. The IRS is on a mission to collect nearly $500 billion owed in back taxes, and they’re not going to stop until they get every penny.</p>
<p>And get this – if you still run and hide – interest now accrues DAILY, not monthly!</p>
<h4><strong>What does this MEAN?</strong></h4>
<p><img class="wp-image-1697 alignleft" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/458-Billion-Debt-Owed-The-IRS-Are-on-Their-Way-chaos-paperwork-man-giving-up.jpg" alt="" width="169" height="234" /></p>
<p>“You’re paying interest on interest on interest every day,” said IRS national taxpayer advocate Nina Olson. “The worst thing you can do if you have a debt is do nothing at all.”</p>
<p>It may be time to meet with an Enrolled Agent to review your federal tax payments. An experienced EA can pull your IRS transcripts, analyze the findings, and let you know where you stand.</p>
<p>The IRS has much more power than ever before. In fact, Pete Sepp – president of the <a href="https://www.ntu.org/">National Taxpayers Union</a> &#8211; claims, “The IRS has a huge suite of tools to get taxpayers to pay back taxes and some of those tools are very blunt.”</p>
<h4><strong>What will they DO?</strong></h4>
<p>The IRS WILL seize property, garnish your wages and take legal action by all means necessary.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-1696 alignright" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/458-Billion-Debt-Owed-The-IRS-are-on-their-way-passport-revoked-travel-irs.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="210" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/458-Billion-Debt-Owed-The-IRS-are-on-their-way-passport-revoked-travel-irs.jpg 4000w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/458-Billion-Debt-Owed-The-IRS-are-on-their-way-passport-revoked-travel-irs-300x209.jpg 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/458-Billion-Debt-Owed-The-IRS-are-on-their-way-passport-revoked-travel-irs-768x536.jpg 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/458-Billion-Debt-Owed-The-IRS-are-on-their-way-passport-revoked-travel-irs-1024x715.jpg 1024w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/458-Billion-Debt-Owed-The-IRS-are-on-their-way-passport-revoked-travel-irs-700x489.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>It’s definitely time to be proactive (if we can even still use that word). Have you heard about the IRS’s new <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2018-07-06/hundreds-of-thousands-at-risk-for-passport-denial-because-of-tax-debt">passport revocation abilities</a>? We have learned that around 362,000 Americans with unpaid tax debts will not be able to apply for or renew passports until their debts are settled. The law now actually <strong>requires</strong> the IRS and the State to deny or revoke passports for people who have an overdue tax debt of $51k or more.</p>
<h4><strong>How do I fix this?</strong></h4>
<p>Fixing your debts becomes absolutely crucial when the IRS holds as much power as they now do. Contact your <a href="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/media/">enrolled agent</a>; they have the means necessary to fix your tax and debt issues before things begin to get messy.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #000000;">Summer is prime time for Americans to travel internationally. From May through September 2017, <a style="color: #000000;" href="https://travel.trade.gov/view/m-2017-O-001/index.html">over 1.6 million U.S. citizens per month</a> traveled outside the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">A good percentage of these travelers just may have hit just a snag.</span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Got a Big Tax Debt? No Passport for You</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">There are over 362,000 Americans with overdue tax debts large enough to be denied passports according to the IRS and</span> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/thousands-of-americans-will-be-denied-a-passport-because-of-unpaid-taxes-1530869401">as reported recently in the Wall Street Journal</a>.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-1319 alignright" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Traveling-Overseas-Not-if-You-Owe-Back-Taxes-SFS-Tax-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Airport-Traveling-International-Travel-300x200.png" alt="Traveling Overseas, Not if You Owe Back Taxes, SFS Tax, SFS Tax Problem Solutions, Airport, Traveling, International Travel" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Traveling-Overseas-Not-if-You-Owe-Back-Taxes-SFS-Tax-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Airport-Traveling-International-Travel-300x200.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Traveling-Overseas-Not-if-You-Owe-Back-Taxes-SFS-Tax-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Airport-Traveling-International-Travel-700x466.png 700w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Traveling-Overseas-Not-if-You-Owe-Back-Taxes-SFS-Tax-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Airport-Traveling-International-Travel.png 766w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<h2><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Are You One of Them? </strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In late 2015, Congress passed a law requiring that the IRS must revoke or deny passports to those who owe $51,000 or more in back taxes, penalties, and interest. Enforcement of the law began just a few months ago, in February.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Not everyone who owes that amount will be denied a passport (or renewal of one), however.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">You must be subject to a tax lien or levy in order for your passport to be revoked or denied.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">There are some exceptions, of course. Your passport will not be denied or revoked if:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">A portion of your tax debt includes FBar penalties (assessed for failure to report foreign financial accounts) and, excluding that amount, you owe less than $51,000</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">You are contesting an IRS assessment (either through administrative channels or tax court)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The IRS is currently considering your installment payment agreement or offer in compromise</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">You have a current installment payment plan in place</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">You have an approved offer in compromise</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">You have been the victim of identity theft</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">You have requested innocent spouse relief</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Your tax debt is currently in “non-collectible” status for economic hardship</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">You are in bankruptcy</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">You are serving in a combat zone or area</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">You are in a federally declared disaster area</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As well, you could be issued a passport for emergencies or humanitarian reasons.</span></p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-1320 alignleft" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Traveling-Overseas-Not-if-You-Owe-Back-Taxes-SFS-Tax-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Airport-Travelers-Airport-Food-Court-300x201.png" alt="Traveling Overseas, Not if You Owe Back Taxes, SFS Tax, SFS Tax Problem Solutions, Airport, Travelers, Airport Food Court" width="300" height="201" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Traveling-Overseas-Not-if-You-Owe-Back-Taxes-SFS-Tax-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Airport-Travelers-Airport-Food-Court-300x201.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Traveling-Overseas-Not-if-You-Owe-Back-Taxes-SFS-Tax-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Airport-Travelers-Airport-Food-Court-700x468.png 700w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Traveling-Overseas-Not-if-You-Owe-Back-Taxes-SFS-Tax-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Airport-Travelers-Airport-Food-Court.png 760w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<h2><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>How Do I Know If I’m on the List? </strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Currently, the IRS is in the process of sending names of those who fall into the parameters of the law to the State Department. The IRS is aiming to have this completed by December 31.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">If your name is on the list, you’ll be notified about the same time as your information is sent to the State Department.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The program is in no danger of going away. In fact, it has been working well.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As of late June, over $11.5 million has been paid by 220 people to settle their debt in full. One person paid $1 million to prevent passport denial. On top of this, 1,400 installments have been approved, according to a spokesman for the IRS and reported in the <em>Wall Street Journal.  </em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1321 alignright" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Traveling-Overseas-Not-if-You-Owe-Back-Taxes-SFS-Tax-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Hotel-Business-Traveler-300x203.png" alt="Traveling Overseas, Not if You Owe Back Taxes, SFS Tax, SFS Tax Problem Solutions, Hotel, Business Traveler" width="300" height="203" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Traveling-Overseas-Not-if-You-Owe-Back-Taxes-SFS-Tax-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Hotel-Business-Traveler-300x203.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Traveling-Overseas-Not-if-You-Owe-Back-Taxes-SFS-Tax-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Hotel-Business-Traveler-700x474.png 700w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Traveling-Overseas-Not-if-You-Owe-Back-Taxes-SFS-Tax-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Hotel-Business-Traveler.png 745w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>What Should I Do if I’m on the List? </strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Don’t wait until you’re facing a passport denial.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">If you have a big tax debt, the sooner you deal with it, the better.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Call an experienced Enrolled Agent to help you with getting back into good standing with the IRS for the least amount possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">It’s more than worth it in time and money. Trying to go it alone without in-depth knowledge of tax law, how the IRS works, and the many options available to you, can cost you both.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s only fair, right? We working stiffs (or retired… hey, you’ve earned it) need to pay our taxes in full on time. The same rules apply to celebrities. The <a href="https://www.irs.gov/tax-professionals/enrolled-agents/enrolled-agent-information">Internal Revenue Service</a> doesn’t care who you are. If you owe back taxes, they will come knocking to collect.</p>
<h2><strong><img class="size-medium wp-image-1149 alignright" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Even-Celebrities-Have-to-Pay-Back-Taxes-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Charlie-Sheen-172x300.png" alt="Even Celebrities Have to Pay Back Taxes, SFS Tax Problem Solutions, Charlie Sheen" width="172" height="300" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Even-Celebrities-Have-to-Pay-Back-Taxes-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Charlie-Sheen-172x300.png 172w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Even-Celebrities-Have-to-Pay-Back-Taxes-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Charlie-Sheen.png 339w" sizes="(max-width: 172px) 100vw, 172px" />Charlie Sheen’s Back Taxes</strong></h2>
<p>On April 30 the <a href="https://theblast.com/charlie-sheen-tax-debt/"><em>Blast</em> </a>reported that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Sheen">Charlie Sheen</a> owed nearly $5 million in back taxes for the 2015 tax year. According to the documents, a tax lien was filed on Sheen’s property for $4,967,376.31 on February 18. Ouch!</p>
<p>Nothing happens in a vacuum. This is the same year that his HIV diagnosis became public. A flurry of lawsuits followed, filed by sexual partners claiming they were kept in the dark about his status, according to <em>Page Six</em>.</p>
<p>Sheen was once the highest paid actor on network television; however, his income took a nosedive in 2011 when he left Two and a Half Men TV series.</p>
<p>He also has had two high-profile divorces that have cost him dearly. The monthly amount paid to his two ex-spouses may have dropped to a mere $25K from $55K, according to TMZ. That’s still a lot of money!</p>
<p>Earlier this year he put his house up for sale for nearly ten million dollars. Hopefully, that will take care of the IRS debt.</p>
<p>Now as for 2016 and 2017… we don’t know about that.</p>
<h3><strong><em>So what is a tax lien anyway? </em></strong></h3>
<p>A federal tax lien is a claim by the government against your property. It filed when you do not pay a tax debt, after the IRS sends a notice explaining how much you owe.</p>
<p>If you owe, generally, more than $10,000, the IRS can file a tax lien.</p>
<p>It is posted against your <a href="https://faq.ssa.gov/link/portal/34011/34019/Article/3731/Can-my-Social-Security-benefits-be-garnished-for-alimony-child-support-or-restitution">Social Security</a> number, reduces your credit score and attaches to everything you owe now and in the future until the debt is paid off.</p>
<p>When you apply for a bank loan or prepare to sell your house, you may find out that there is a tax lien. That is, of course, if you missed the IRS notices in the mail.</p>
<p>Obviously, the tax lien can limit your ability to get credit.  If you have business property or accounts receivable, the tax lien is attached to it. Even if you file for bankruptcy, the tax lien can continue.</p>
<p>Finally, if you have a tax lien on your home, you must pay that before you can sell or refinance it. If you have equity in your home, the sales proceeds at the time of closing can go toward paying that tax lien.</p>
<h3><strong><em>How do you avoid a lien? </em></strong></h3>
<p>If you haven’t paid your taxes when you file your return, you’ll receive a notice from the IRS. This notice is the start of the collection process. This first notice will tell you what you owe the IRS.</p>
<p>This is when you need to act.</p>
<p>You can seek advice from a qualified tax professional such as an Enrolled Agent.</p>
<p>You need to do it now.</p>
<p>Why? Because if you do owe the tax, penalties, and interest have been accruing since the date it was due. And they continue to add up as time goes on.</p>
<p>If you’re not able to pay the entire balance right away, you do have options. Your tax professional can walk through those with you.</p>

<p>In late December 2017, it was reported that Lindsay Lohan had back tax troubles. She reportedly owed more than $100,000 for 2010, 2014 and 2015 tax years and the IRS had put liens in place.  The actress stated that she believed one of her managers mishandled funds and vowed to investigate.</p>
<p>Previously, in 2012, it was reported that she owed over $200,000 for the 2009 and 2010 tax years. It got so bad that the IRS seized her accounts. Ironically, Charlie Sheen came to her rescue with a check for $100,000, as reported by <em>Fox News. </em>Lindsay eventually paid the debt at the end of 2012 according to an IRS certificate that TMZ posted on their website.</p>
<h3><strong><em>The IRS can seize accounts? </em></strong></h3>
<p>The short answer is yes, the IRS can seize accounts… or any other property you have.</p>
<p>That’s called a levy.</p>
<p>It’s the next step after placing a lien on your property. The lien secures the government’s claim on your property. With a levy, the IRS takes your property to satisfy your tax debt.</p>
<p>The government can seize your property if you fail to make arrangements to settle your tax debt. They may also use any future tax refund to offset your debt.</p>
<p>What can they seize?</p>
<p>The IRS can seize your wages, your Social Security benefits, your bank accounts and retirement income. They can seize your car or even your home. Any property you have can be seized by the IRS.</p>
<p>How are you supposed to live if all of your income goes to the IRS?</p>
<p>&#8220;Generally, federal law provides that any [wage] garnishment can be no more than 25% of your disposable income, or the amount that your income exceeds 30 times the feral minimum wage, whichever is less,&#8221; explains Jeffrey Schneider in his book,<em> Now What? I Got a Notice from the IRS. Help! </em>&#8220;The amount you can keep corresponds to the number of exemptions you claim for tax purposes.&#8221;</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s enough to live on, however. Schneider gives the example of a single person getting paid weekly with five exemptions. In that case, he or she can only keep $511.54. A married person filing jointly with two exemptions would only be allowed to keep $1,733.33. Yikes!</p>
<p>Once again, you don’t have to let things get to this point. If you’ve received a notice of an outstanding tax debt, take action now. Tax professionals can assess your situation and help you decide the best course to take. They can even speak with the IRS on your behalf.</p>

<p>In 2015, <a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/celebrity/robert-deniro-irs-tax-lien-897432"><em>The Smoking Gun</em></a> reported that Robert DeNiro owed $6.4 million to the IRS for back taxes for the 2013 tax year.</p>
<p>The IRS sent notice after notice – to the wrong address – and ultimately filed a lien.</p>
<p>In DeNiro’s case, he was able to whip out a checkbook and take care of it the minute he learned of it.</p>
<p>That’s great for Robert DeNiro, right? Well for us regular folk we may not be able to settle our tax debt right away.  As mentioned previously, you do have options.</p>
<p>Consulting with a tax professional can help you determine the best course of action. Each individual situation is unique and deserves a thorough evaluation.</p>
<p>Oh, and do yourself a favor. Put in a forwarding of address order with the post office so you receive notices mailed to your previous residence.</p>
<h2><strong>So what is the lesson in all this? </strong></h2>
<p>If you have back taxes, or even if you think you might, it pays to address them right away.</p>
<p>The minute you are delinquent on your taxes, interest, and penalties start to add up. There’s no reason to add to your woes. Don’t let it get to the point where the IRS is putting a lien against or even seizing your property through a levy.</p>
