<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>“Not everyone is qualified to be a captain of a ship. When you’re miles from land and things get dicey, you want an Admiral, not a weekend sailor. You need a professional who knows what he or she is doing.”</strong></p>
<p>If your case gets remanded back to appeals, there are two other credentialed professionals that can represent you: the Certified Public Accountant and the Enrolled Agent.</p>
<p>Most tax return preparers provide outstanding service, however, they have differing levels of skill, as well as continuing education requirements and expertise.</p>
<p>Preparers with<strong> unlimited</strong> representation rights can represent their clients on any matters – including audits, payment collection issues, and appeals.</p>
<p>Preparers with<strong> limited</strong> representation rights can only represent clients whose returns they have prepared and signed.</p>
<h2><strong>Credentialed Return Preparers</strong></h2>
<p>Tax return preparers with <strong>unlimited</strong> rights include professionals with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enrolled Agents: Licensed by the IRS. Must pass a three-part Special Enrollment Examination. This is a comprehensive exam that requires them to demonstrate proficiency in federal tax planning, individual and business tax return preparation, and representation.</li>
<li>Attorneys: Licensed by state courts. Attorneys have earned a degree in law and have passed a bar exam. They may offer a range of services, and some specialize in tax preparation and planning.</li>
<li>Certified Public Accountants: Licensed by state courts. CPAs have passed the Uniform CPA Examination. They have completed a study of accounting at a college or university. They may offer a range of services, and some specialize in tax preparation and planning.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><img class="alignright wp-image-3539" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/The-Taxpayer-Representative-woman-sitting-desk-journal-note-taking-now-what-help-sfs-tax.jpg" alt="The Taxpayer Representative, woman, sitting, desk, journal, note taking, now what help, sfs tax" width="517" height="363" /></strong>If you are dealing with an audit, you cannot just walk into any tax return preparers’ office. Only an Enrolled Agent, a CPA, or an attorney can help you with an IRS issue.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>“Ask what those initials mean in the big scheme toward solving your problem. After all, you’ll be on the boat together and entrusting him or her with your financial life. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>You deserve to be certain you have the right one before you turn over the controls.” </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Where to Research for Preparers</strong></h2>
<p>The IRS has a searchable, sortable public directory at <a href="https://irs.treasury.gov/rpo/rpo.jsf">https://irs.treasury.gov/rpo/rpo.jsf</a> to search for various tax preparers.</p>
