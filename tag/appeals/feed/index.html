			<p>IRS Appeals</p>
<p>An unexpected envelope from the Internal Revenue Service is never a good thing.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s never pleasant, but any letter that you receive should not be ignored, especially if you disagree with an IRS decision.</p>
<p>In fact, the IRS Taxpayer Bill of Rights covers this specific situation as one of a taxpayer&#8217;s rights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay no more than the correct amount of tax,</li>
<li>Challenge the IRS&#8217; position and be heard and</li>
<li>Appeal an IRS decision in an independent forum</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some tips on getting through an IRS disagreement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get professional help: First, if you don&#8217;t have a tax professional, get one.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if your disputed tax situation is not that complicated, dealing with the IRS can be difficult. A tax professional that has standing with the IRS, like an Enrolled Agent (EA), CPA, or attorney with experience in resolving issues between the IRS and taxpayers can save you time, and money. A Certified Tax Resolution Specialist (CTRS) is specially trained to argue your case before the IRS.</p>
<ul>
<li>Know the general appeals process: Your tax pro will help you understand what to expect and what happens during your appeal process.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Appeals Office is separate from and independent of the IRS office that took action against you. It&#8217;s also the only level of administrative appeal within the IRS.</p>
<p>Conferences with an Appeals Office representative can be held informally by correspondence, telephone, or at a face-to-face meeting.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to have official representation at an appeals conference, but as noted at the beginning of this post, it&#8217;s generally a good idea.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4156" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IRS-letter-300x251.png" alt="IRS letter-sfs tax problem solutions" width="300" height="251" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IRS-letter-300x251.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IRS-letter-768x644.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IRS-letter-700x587.png 700w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IRS-letter.png 940w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Preparation is essential: If you do go to the Appeals Office, be prepared to discuss all issues you don&#8217;t agree with at the conference.</p>
<p>You also might need to file a formal written protest or a small case request with the office named in the IRS letter you received.</p>
<p>And definitely be sure to file your protest within the time limit specified in the letter you received.</p>
<p>Specifically, Appeals isn&#8217;t interested in and won&#8217;t accept any objection you have based on moral, religious, political, constitutional, conscientious, or similar grounds.</p>
<ul>
<li>Let the pros handle it: Your tax adviser can file the written protest for you.</li>
</ul>
<p>He or she also can take care of the discussions or hearings without you if you decide you just don&#8217;t want to go it alone.</p>
<p>If you do opt to skip the Appeal Office meeting and send only your lawyer, CPA or EA to make your case, be sure you have completed a power of attorney form allowing your representative to receive and inspect confidential information.</p>
<ul>
<li>Beyond Appeals: The IRS says that going through the Office of Appeals process generally settles most tax disputes without expensive and time-consuming court trials.</li>
</ul>
<p>If, however, that&#8217;s not the case in your tax disagreement, you can take your protest to the judicial level. This includes appeals to the United States Tax Court, the United States Court of Federal Claims or your United States District Court.</p>
<p>In difficult times, many families have trouble meeting their commitments. If you’re worried about the IRS garnishing your wages, levying your bank account, or taking your home,</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-4151" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tax-problems_-1-300x158.png" alt="IRS desk, man with pen, SFS" width="392" height="207" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tax-problems_-1-300x158.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tax-problems_-1-768x404.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tax-problems_-1.png 1000w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tax-problems_-1-700x368.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 392px) 100vw, 392px" /> then reaching out to our firm and getting a free, no-obligation, confidential consultation on your tax problem may give you some peace of mind.  Jeffrey Schneider, EA, CTRS is a tax expert and can work with you to file your back taxes and get you tax compliant.

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Forget 10,000 Leagues Under the Sea. You’ll have to dive much deeper than that to get to the heart of the IRS.</strong></h2>
<p>When it comes to the administration and enforcement of our tax system, there are four basic levels:</p>
<h2><strong><img class="wp-image-3636 size-full alignright" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Chapter-Meme-B-1.jpg" alt="" width="526" height="526" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Chapter-Meme-B-1.jpg 526w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Chapter-Meme-B-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Chapter-Meme-B-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Chapter-Meme-B-1-500x500.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px" /></strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Examinations (Audits)</li>
<li>Collections</li>
<li>Appeals</li>
<li>Criminal Investigations</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s time to talk about the first three.</p>
<h2><strong>Examinations (Audits) </strong></h2>
<p>When a return is filed and processed, it is automatically deemed correct unless the IRS computers find an error.</p>
<h3><strong>What types of errors are picked up by the computers?</strong></h3>
<p>If you understate the income reported, overreport expenses, or report you had health insurance when you did not, the computer spits out a notice showing what they have compared to what you’ve put on your return.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you’ll get selected for audit (done locally or by mail). The auditor can pick up on these same errors or omissions.</p>
<h2><strong>Collections</strong></h2>
<p>The Internal Revenue Service is the world’s largest and most aggressive collection agency. Even with their funding woes, they can and will come after you (either in person or by mail <a href="https://sfstaxacct.com/2019/04/2019-dirty-dozen-list-of-tax-scams/">– never a phone call or email.</a>)</p>
<h2><strong><img class="alignright wp-image-3638 " src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/You-Have-It-We-Want-It-sfs-now-what-help-courtroom-courthouse-outside-2.jpg" alt="" width="427" height="645" /></strong></h2>
<p>One of the IRS collection units is the Automated Collections Service, or ACS. They have various service centers around the country. Then, there are Settlement Officers. These officials are usually in the IRS Appeals Office.</p>
<h2><strong>Appeals </strong></h2>
<p>A taxpayer usually gets one shot at appeals. The next step is to prepare and file a tax court petition. Generally, you can file this once you receive a 90-day notice (Statutory Notice of Deficiency.) You can prepare the petition:</p>
<ul>
<li>yourself</li>
<li>by a U.S. Tax Court Practitioner</li>
<li>by an attorney licensed to practice in your state</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, there is a $60 fee. You will wait until your petition gets on the court docket. Then, it is assigned to an IRS lawyer. Most of the time, IRS attorneys will “send it back to appeals,” because most cases are not USTC worthy (i.e. not enough money).</p>
<p>If you do not want to go to court (it is not cheap unless you do it yourself, and that is not highly recommended) and you cannot/do not pay, that is the crux of this book.</p>
<p>Just as you have the right to appeal an IRS decision, you also have the right to be represented.</p>
