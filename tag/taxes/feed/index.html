			<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">After years of flying under the radar, taxpayers who hold Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and other cryptocurrencies are finally getting scrutinized by the IRS its time to come clean about taxes on cryptocurrency. The IRS has determined that cryptocurrency is here to stay and that the outrageous refunds that early adopters have enjoyed could be a massive windfall for government coffers.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">The tax agency has also figured out that many earliest adopters to late comers who are holders of crypto could owe a lot of money on these assets. The currency may be virtual, but to the IRS, the taxes that are due are all too real.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">Note &#8211; if you think you might owe back taxes on your crypto, we encourage all readers to contact us at </span><a href="http://bit.ly/2Hh7cEl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><span style="color: #0e101a;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://bit.ly/2Hh7cE</span>l</span></em></a><span style="color: #0e101a;">. Contact us today for a free, no-obligation, confidential consultation.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">The Illusion of Anonymity</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">If you have been skating along under the veil of anonymity and failing to report your cryptocurrency holdings, you might want to rethink your strategy. After years of taking a mostly hands-off approach, the IRS is catching up in a big way. The agency is pulling out all the stops to recover the money the government believes is owed to them.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">Many holders of cryptocurrency are under the mistaken impression that their transactions are totally anonymous, and that there is no way for the IRS, or anyone else, to tell how much they hold or how they use their virtual coins. That may be a soothing fiction, but the reality is far different.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">The truth is that the IRS has a wide range of options at its disposal. From official form filings to subpoenas and legal documents, to pierce the veil of anonymity and find the real-world identities of cryptocurrency holders.</span></p>
<h5><strong><img class="alignright wp-image-4821" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IRS-form-1099-K-2020-300x158.png" alt="come clean about taxes on cryptocurrency- form 1099K" width="532" height="280" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IRS-form-1099-K-2020-300x158.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IRS-form-1099-K-2020-768x404.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IRS-form-1099-K-2020.png 1000w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IRS-form-1099-K-2020-700x368.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 532px) 100vw, 532px" />Did You Get a 1099-K? Well, So Did the IRS</strong></h5>
<p>In some cases, holders of cryptocurrency are finding tax forms in their mailboxes. If you receive this form, you can be sure the IRS received a copy as well.</p>
<p>When you file your taxes, an automatic matching program will compare the amount you claimed with the amount on these automatically generated forms. If there is a mismatch, you will hear from the IRS.</p>
<p>One of the most common forms used to report cryptocurrency holdings and transactions is the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/understanding-your-form-1099-k">1099-K</a>. For sellers on eBay and some freelancers, this form will already be familiar. Still, it is being extended into the virtual world as well. If you receive a 1099-K form this year, it is time to come clean with your cryptocurrency holdings.</p>
<h5><strong>The Cryptocurrency Question and Your Tax Form</strong></h5>
<p>Until now, cryptocurrency holders could and often did, plead ignorance. They could claim they did not realize their Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other virtual holdings were taxable. They could back up that assertion by saying the IRS never asked them about these assets. Time to come clean about taxes on cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>The validity of that excuse may have been questionable. Now that thin veil of supposed ignorance will be gone. Beginning with the 2019 tax return, taxpayers will be asked directly on their 1040 if they bought, sold, transacted, or otherwise acquired any cryptocurrency. They will be expected to answer that question truthfully.</p>
<p>The wording of this question means anyone who holds any cryptocurrency would be required to answer in the affirmative. Even so, merely holding virtual coins in a cryptocurrency wallet does not necessarily imply any taxes will be due. Someone who holds cryptocurrency but makes no transactions should not owe any taxes just as a holder of stock does not owe taxes until they sell the shares.</p>
<p>Come clean about taxes on cryptocurrency as the IRS is getting serious about cryptocurrency, drawn by a combination of past returns, unreported taxes, and increased exposure of these alternative forms of payment.</p>

			<p>There have been a lot of stories about surprised taxpayers this year, and many of those surprises were decidedly unpleasant. Taxpayers who had received large refunds for years were shocked to find that they owed the IRS money this year, sometimes thousands of dollars in additional taxes due. Let&#8217;s face it, nobody likes a surprise tax bill.</p>
<h3><strong><img class="alignright wp-image-3869" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Steps-to-Take-if-You-Received-a-Surprise-Tax-Bill-mailbox-surprise-mail.jpg" alt="" width="613" height="533" /></strong></h3>
<p>Still others were shocked to find an IRS notice in their mailboxes &#8211; a formal letter detailing an additional tax liability and demanding payment for taxes due. These IRS notices can leave even the most conscientious tax filer blindsided &#8211; and wondering what to do next.</p>
<p>Whether you expected a refund and received a bill or found a notice from the IRS lurking in your mailbox, what you do next matters a great deal. Here are some critical steps to take if you owe money to the IRS.</p>
<h3><strong>Stop Panicking</strong></h3>
<p>There is no scarier piece of mail than a notice from the IRS, especially if that notice comes with a big tax bill attached. Even so, a notification of additional taxes due is no excuse to panic, and worrying will not make the problem go away.</p>
<p>So calm down, think rationally and plan your next steps carefully. There are right and wrong ways to address the issue, and the steps you take next could make all the difference.</p>
<h3><strong>Double-Check Your Math and Gather Your Documents</strong></h3>
<p>Something as simple as a transposed number or mismatched form could trigger a notice from the IRS, but the good news is these problems can be easy to resolve. Before you do anything else, go back to your original documents and double-check your numbers.</p>
<p>Compare the 1099 forms and W2s you received with the numbers you entered on your return. If there are inconsistencies and errors, you may be able to simply file an amended return and resolve the issue.</p>
<h3><strong>Contact a Tax Resolution Firm</strong></h3>
<p>Your tax preparer can be a big help when you receive an audit notice or demand for additional taxes from the IRS, but chances are they won’t know how to negotiate with the IRS nor will they fully understand your options for tax relief.</p>
<p>Working with a firm that specializes in tax debt relief and tax resolution, you’ll be able to map out a plan to get your back taxes taken care of.</p>
<h3><strong>Ask About Possible Penalty Forgiveness <img class="alignright wp-image-3870" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Steps-to-Take-if-You-Received-a-Surprise-Tax-Bill-administration-adult-girl-reading-papers.jpg" alt="" width="533" height="528" /></strong></h3>
<p>Changes to the tax code have left many taxpayers owing money to the IRS when they expected to be cashing big refund checks. The limitations in the deductibility of state and local taxes, coupled with updates to the withholding tables, have left millions of taxpayers in this situation.</p>
<p>The IRS has taken notice, and the tax agency has been waiving underpayment penalties and interest for many of the affected taxpayers. If you are completing your tax return and find that you owe money to the IRS, ask us about possible waivers for part of the amount due. You will still be responsible for the taxes you owe, but you may be able to get relief from any penalties and interest.</p>
<p>Owing money to the IRS is frightening, but the tax agency is not entirely lacking in compassion. The IRS knows that many taxpayers will have trouble making their payments in full, and the agency may be willing to set up a more affordable payment plan.</p>
<h3><strong>Seek Payment Arrangements with the IRS</strong></h3>
<p>If you receive a surprise tax bill you should try to pay what you owe, assuming it’s correct and your tax preparer already lowered your tax liability to the lowest amount allowed by law.</p>
<p>If you are unable to pay what you owe, contact our firm and we can help you setup a properly structured payment plan that can save you a lot in the long run.</p>
<p>Keep in mind you could be on the hook for additional penalties, as well as interest on your outstanding balance.</p>
<p>Owing money to the IRS is scary, and having a large tax liability can wreak havoc with your finances and your life. Even so, there are things you can do to ease the burden, so you can pay what you owe and send the IRS on its way. The steps outlined above can help you get a handle on the situation, so you can rest easy and stop worrying about your tax bill.</p>
<p>If you want an expert tax resolution professional who knows how to navigate the IRS maze, reach out to our firm and we’ll schedule a no-obligation confidential consultation to explain your options to permanently resolve your tax problem.</p>

Here’s What to Do.</strong></h1>
<p>The IRS takes unpaid payroll taxes seriously. These are some of the worst kind of back taxes you can owe. If you’re a small business owner with payroll tax problems, read on to learn what you can do to avoid the IRS crippling your business or worse, shut your business down completely.</p>
<p>And why would they do this? When you withhold taxes from employees’ checks, it is not yours. Not paying taxes is considered stealing.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-3674 " src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Small-Business-Owner-Owe-Payroll-Taxes-Here’s-What-to-Do-stressed-man-pay-phone-calling-making-phone-call-1.jpg" alt="Small Business Owner, Owe Payroll Taxes, Here’s What to Do, stressed, man, pay phone, calling, making phone call" width="510" height="497" /></p>
<h2><strong>Why Small Business Owners Get Into Payroll Tax Trouble In The First Place</strong></h2>
<p>It’s hard being a small business owner today, trying to pay your employees their paychecks every week, and pay the IRS all those payroll taxes.</p>
<p>A lot of times when money is short, you pay the employees first. You need to be able to take care of them even if it means not paying yourself.  If nothing else, the process of having to find new employees is a pain – don’t make them quit on you!</p>
<p>It can seem easy to “just pay it next pay period” and give yourself a little cash flow cushion, but skipping paying your employees payroll tax deposits is never a good idea.</p>
<p>What happens too often is one pay period turns into 2, and 3, and 4, and eventually you’re so deep in payroll tax debt that the only thing you want to do is completely ignore your problem.</p>
<p>The IRS doesn’t care if you can’t pay your employees.  They don’t care if they put your employees out on the street. It just doesn’t matter if you can’t collect your receivables.  They don’t care if one of your largest and best customers just went “belly-up”. You have money that belongs to them and they will do whatever they have to. They’ll put you out of business to collect it. They don’t care who you are or what business you are in.</p>
<h2><strong>Penalties are The Kiss Of Death When It Comes to Back Payroll Taxes</strong></h2>
<p>Penalties for failing to file and pay your payroll taxes are the “kiss of death” for any small business owner. They tack on penalties totaling 33% in just the first 16 days! And it doesn’t stop there.  The IRS adds interest on top of the penalties too. It is not uncommon that a payroll tax liability doubles in short order. And if you don’t pay them or work something out, they will shut you down. Why would a Revenue Officer want to work out an arrangement with you when shutting your business down is much less work?</p>
<h2><strong><img class="wp-image-3164 aligncenter" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Small-Business-Owner-Owe-Payroll-Taxes-Here’s-What-To-Do-chart-federal-tax-deposit-penalties.jpg" alt="Small Business Owner Owe Payroll Taxes Here’s What To Do, chart, federal tax deposit penalties" width="828" height="242" /></strong></h2>
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>The IRS Will Collect or They Will Shut You Down</strong></h2>
<p>It’s as simple as that.  The IRS is the most brutal collection agency on the planet.  They have more authority than the President of the United States. Therefore, they have all the ways and means to do whatever it takes to collect what’s owed to them. Even though you certainly didn’t expect to be short in funds, you weren’t avoiding payroll taxes because you didn’t want to. The money simply wasn’t there.  It’s not your fault.  One week you’re short of cash.  It was a slow week, a customer’s check bounced, or any number of legitimate reasons that just prevent you from paying the IRS.  The next week comes and goes, and you realize you still don’t have enough money to make that payroll tax deposit.  And then the entire situation starts “snow-balling” into an avalanche.</p>
<h2><strong>Should You Call The IRS To Get Your Payroll Issue Fixed? <img class="alignright wp-image-3675 " src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Small-Business-Owner-Owe-Payroll-Taxes-Here’s-What-to-Do-stress-colored-pencil-writing-red-1.jpg" alt="Small Business Owner, Owe Payroll Taxes, Here’s What to Do, stress, colored pencil, writing, red" width="488" height="362" /></strong></h2>
<p>If you were to call the IRS, and were able to get through after waiting on “hold” for an hour or more, and try to explain your situation—you might as well have a conversation with the wall—because they don’t care.  The IRS representative that you’re talking to probably makes less than $20 an hour, isn’t properly equipped to handle too many issues.  These representatives have probably never made a payroll in their life. Do you think they know what it’s like running a small business? Do you really think they will have any sympathy for you?</p>
<p>Not only is the answer “NO” but they can also dictate the fate of your case. What they will try to get, while you’re on the phone, is all your personal and financial information.  They want to know where you bank; they’ll want to know all about your customers who owe you money, they’ll want to know about the value of all your assets, like your home, cars, motorcycles, etc. Why? Because now they have all the information they need to levy your bank accounts, take your receivables and seize your property.</p>
<p>Plus, customer service is a misnomer. You are not their customer, the government is!</p>
<p>Now that you know you shouldn’t be talking to the IRS because they are not going to help you, you might be wondering what you should do?  Where should you turn for help?  They smartest thing you can do to protect your business and family is to have someone represent you—someone who deals with the IRS for a living. You need to get help from an experienced tax expert. An Enrolled Agent deals with the IRS every day, helping small business owners keep their businesses and settle IRS payroll tax problems.</p>

<p>How long has it been? 3 years? More? 10? Some people have never filed taxes. Why not? <img class="alignright wp-image-3707 " src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Havent-Filed-Taxes-in-a-While-child-oops-shocked-face-tea-cup-1.jpg" alt="Haven't Filed Taxes in a While, child, oops, shocked face, tea cup" width="200" height="319" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“I knew I owed them, and I didn’t want to face the consequences.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“I couldn’t gather all of my records.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“My ex used to do them for me. I never learned how!”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“My accountant died.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“I’m in too deep.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“If I bring attention to the issue, the IRS is going to notice me and find things I never even <strong>realized</strong> I did wrong.”</em></p>
<h2><strong>Why Do We Have to File Tax Returns? </strong></h2>
<h2><strong><img class="alignright wp-image-3708 " src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Havent-Filed-Taxes-in-a-While-vacation-destination-beach-airplane-1.jpg" alt="" width="345" height="441" /></strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>It’s against the law not to file. This can be a felony… and you don’t it want following you the rest of your life.</li>
<li>If you’d like to buy or refinance a house, you need to prove that you’ve filed your returns.</li>
<li>If you want to get married one day, not filing can be a deal breaker because it carries <em>tons </em>of problems.</li>
<li>The IRS might file substitute-for-returns for you without deductions and you’ll owe them more than if you had just filed yourself.</li>
<li>If you owe $50,000 or more, your passport privileges will be revoked by the IRS. This means you can’t escape to Mexico before getting caught.</li>
<li>If you’re self-employed, you might miss out on increased Social Security contributions for when you retire.</li>
<li>You’re required to have filed to obtain health insurance.</li>
<li>You won’t be able to get student loan aid for your kids (FAFSA)</li>
<li>It will reduce your chances of having your identity stolen.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Do I Need to File Every Year?</strong></h2>
<p>Not typically, no. The IRS wants to see your last seven years of returns on file. However, if the IRS filed for you, you’ll want to replace the Substitute for Returns with returns of your own to reduce the balance they assessed. If you’re getting refunds and won’t owe taxes, you only have to worry about the last 4 years.</p>
<h2><strong>Alright, This is Too Much</strong></h2>
<p>Your Enrolled Agent will take thorough information on your tax situation and can handle this for you. Jeffrey A. Schneider EA, CTRS, NTPIF, ACT-E can determine exactly the number of years that need to be filed. He can find out whether the IRS has filed for you or not, find out whether or not you’ll be getting refunds that you may be entitled to, and set you up for future success.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>More Recent Tax Cases You’ll Enjoy Reading About (Tax Fraud)</strong></h1>
<p>If you liked our <a href="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/tax-cases/">last</a> stories, these will blow you away.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-2668" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/More-Recent-Tax-Cases-You’ll-Enjoy-Reading-About-Tax-Fraud-Shirley-New-York-NYC.jpg" alt="More Recent Tax Cases You’ll Enjoy Reading About (Tax Fraud), Shirley, New York, NYC" width="282" height="222" /></p>
<h3><strong>Shirley, N.Y.</strong></h3>
<p>In our first short story, we’ll introduce Fred Towle Jr., 52. Towle pleaded guilty to endorsing a false return for 2012 that underreported his business income.</p>
<p>Towle owned the company East Coast Marketing. He used this company to consult with political candidates and assist homeowners for his own gain. Furthermore, he was expediting approvals for permits from various governmental entities in Suffolk County, N.Y.</p>
<p>Towle’s fraudulent activity began in 2012. He falsely reported no taxable income from businesses controlled by him, including East Coast Marketing. Knowing that he was earning approximately $246,000 in taxable corporate income for that year, he still claimed nothing.<br />
Between tax years 2012 and 2014, Towle failed to declare approximately $1.2 million in income; this resulted in a tax loss to the U.S. of some $307,427.</p>
<p>Towle faces a maximum of three years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. His plea included an agreement to pay $307,427 in restitution, which was the full amount of his tax liabilities.</p>
<h3><strong>Hamden, Conn. <img class="alignright  wp-image-2669" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/More-Recent-Tax-Cases-You’ll-Enjoy-Reading-About-Tax-Fraud-Hamden-Connecticut-CT.jpg" alt="More Recent Tax Cases You’ll Enjoy Reading About (Tax Fraud), Hamden, Connecticut, CT" width="361" height="240" /></strong></h3>
<p>Next, we have Ira Malkin, 49. This salesman is guilty of tax evasion, and was sentenced six months in prison. He also has three years of supervised release.</p>
<p>Malkin worked as a principal salesman for Good Copy Printing Center Inc., New Haven -according to court documents and statements in court. He earned substantial commissions and GCP paid many of Malkin’s personal expenses.</p>
<p>With Malkin’s consent, GCP reduced his commissions by the amount of personal expenses the company paid. He then reported to the IRS that Malkin had earned substantially less income than he truly earned.</p>
<p>In a second scenario, GCP handled printing jobs for Comcast. GCP mailed flyers and paid the postage with the expectation that the company would be reimbursed for that expense. Malkin had GCP pay the postage for the Comcast mailings and made Comcast reimburse him for the cost of the mailings. GCP reduced his earned commissions by the amount of postage paid by GCP. Through this arrangement, between approximately 2009 and 2012 GCP further under-reported Malkin’s income on filed W-2s.</p>
<p>Through this scheme, Malkin underreported more than $1.5 million in income. He skipped out on $484,581 in federal income taxes! Even though he pleaded guilty in February and paid all of his back taxes, Malkin still owes the IRS more than $700,000 in interest and penalties.</p>
<p>During his supervised release, he must spend six months in home confinement and perform 200 hours of community service.</p>
<h3><strong><img class="alignleft  wp-image-2670" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/More-Recent-Tax-Cases-You’ll-Enjoy-Reading-About-Tax-Fraud-Fairfield-Ohio.jpg" alt="More Recent Tax Cases You’ll Enjoy Reading About (Tax Fraud), Fairfield, Ohio" width="298" height="227" />Fairfield, Ohio</strong></h3>
<p>Preparer Janet Benitez, 44, who prepared returns for illegal aliens and concealed her own income, pleaded guilty to filing a false income tax return, according to published reports.</p>
<p>During the course of 5 years, Benitez reportedly submitted returns on behalf of 23 illegal aliens seeking fraudulent refunds of at least $123,999. She not only failed to report her prep fees for tax years 2011 through 2015, but she filed false income tax returns in her name and her spouse’s name when she should have filed one return that combined their income. However, this would have resulted in tax due… apparently a cost she didn’t want to pay.</p>
<p>She has reportedly agreed to pay $265,839 in restitution to the IRS.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Filing a false income tax return carries a maximum of three years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.</p>
<h3><strong>Peabody, Mass. <img class="alignright  wp-image-2671" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/More-Recent-Tax-Cases-You’ll-Enjoy-Reading-About-Tax-Fraud-Peabody-Massachusetts-MA.jpg" alt="More Recent Tax Cases You’ll Enjoy Reading About (Tax Fraud), Peabody, Massachusetts, MA" width="339" height="240" /></strong></h3>
<p>William Panousos, 67; his wife, Theodora, 65; and their son, Konstantinos, 39 were taken down as family. These current and former owners of Giovanni’s Roast Beef &amp; Pizza have been sentenced in connection with skimming cash receipts from Giovanni’s and failing to report the cash on their tax returns. They avoided payment of some $550,000 in taxes.</p>
<p>The family each received three years’ probation, with the first 18 months confined to the City of Peabody. Next, they were ordered to pay a fine of $150,000. They were also ordered to pay restitution of $549,883 to the IRS.</p>
<p>In November, all three pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud the U.S. William Panousos also pleaded guilty to three counts of aiding and assisting in filing false corporate and individual returns. Theodora pleaded guilty to four counts and Konstantinos to two.</p>
<p>During tax years 2013 through 2015, the Panousoses skimmed some $2.8 million in cash receipts from Giovanni’s and did not deposit them into the business’ bank account or report them to their preparer. They diverted about $1.5 million of those cash receipts to their own personal use. They used the rest of the skimmed cash to pay some of their business expenses, including a portion of payments to suppliers and a portion of employees’ salaries. In addition, the defendants failed to report those cash expenses on their returns.</p>
<h3><strong><img class="alignleft  wp-image-2672" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/More-Recent-Tax-Cases-You’ll-Enjoy-Reading-About-Tax-Fraud-Whiting-Ohio-OH.jpg" alt="More Recent Tax Cases You’ll Enjoy Reading About (Tax Fraud), Whiting, Ohio, OH" width="340" height="249" />Whiting, Iowa</strong></h3>
<p>Farmer Kurt Neldeberg, 65, filed false and fraudulent returns and has been sentenced to two years’ probation.</p>
<p>Neldeberg pleaded guilty in February. He admitted that from at least 2009 through 2012, he failed to report some $315,512 in income from grain sales. This resulted in more than $100,000 in unpaid taxes due and owing.</p>
<p>He admitted that he deposited proceeds from farm grain sales into personal bank accounts and failed to inform his bookkeeper and his preparer that he had done so. His farm receipts on Schedule F of his joint federal returns resulted in under-reported income for each of the tax years 2009 through 2012.</p>
<p>Neldeberg was also ordered to complete 120 hours of community service, to pay a $100 special assessment and to make full restitution to the IRS. Neldeberg previously posted a $125,000 cash bond to the IRS for restitution.</p>
<h3><strong>St. Louis<img class="alignright  wp-image-2674" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/More-Recent-Tax-Cases-You’ll-Enjoy-Reading-About-Tax-Fraud-St-Louis-Missouri-MO.jpg" alt="More Recent Tax Cases You’ll Enjoy Reading About (Tax Fraud), St Louis, Missouri, MO" width="352" height="197" /> </strong></h3>
<p>Prep-service operator Asmerom “Ace” Keleta, 33, has been sentenced to five years in prison for conspiring to defraud the U.S. through tax fraud and for preparing fraudulent returns.</p>
<p>According to court documents, Keleta operated University City Tax Service starting in 2012. He conspired with employees Miyoshi Lewis and Teklom Paulos to prepare fraudulent returns for clients. Keleta directed the employees to inflate refunds by listing false American Opportunity Credits and federal fuel tax credits. He also created false Schedule C income to fraudulently maximize Earned Income Tax Credits.</p>
<p>Keleta also prepared false returns for clients and, as owner of University City Tax, received a percentage of clients’ inflated refunds.</p>
<p>He was also ordered to pay $662,645 in restitution.</p>

<h3><strong>Atlanta</strong></h3>
<p>A federal court has barred preparer Marjorie St. Jean and MarjorieStjeanLLC from preparing federal returns for others and owning or operating a prep business.</p>
<p>The court also ordered that St. Jean and MarjorieStjeanLLC pay $367,346.14, representing the gains for the preparation of returns making false claims.</p>
<p>St. Jean and MarjorieStjeanLLC, an entity through which she operates prep stores, prepared returns that included fraudulent claims for the EITC, often based on bogus dependents, fabricated business income and expenses or false filing statuses. The court also determined that MarjorieStjeanLLC often prepared returns that falsely claimed fuel tax credits, household help income, unreimbursed employee business expenses and self-employment income or expenses.</p>

<p>Demolition executive Hugo Santamaria has been sentenced to two years in prison for tax and structuring crimes.</p>
<p>According to case documents and information, Santamaria pleaded guilty in August 2017 to structuring cash transactions to avoid currency transaction reports and conspiring to defraud the U.S. Beginning in 2006, Santamaria owned and operated multiple demolition companies and conspired with his business partner in those companies to conceal income from the IRS and evade personal income taxes.</p>
<p>He engaged in such acts of evasion as opening bank accounts for his co-conspirator to hide income and serving as a nominee for his co-conspirator’s businesses. Santamaria also wrote, signed and cashed numerous checks and made cash withdrawals in amounts less than $10,000 on consecutive days. He and his co-conspirator also paid workers in cash and failed to withhold and pay over any payroll taxes.</p>
<p>Santamaria admitted to paying himself a weekly salary from company bank accounts. He also admitted a number of crimes, including paying personal expenses with the business bank accounts. This includes food, lodging, clothing, gym memberships and tuition for private school. Simultaneously, he has not filed a personal tax return since 2007.</p>
<h6>The Sentencing</h6>
<p>They ordered Santamaria three years of supervised release and to pay $26,213 in restitution to the IRS.</p>
<h4><strong>Amherst, N.Y.</strong></h4>
<p>Realtor Maxim Levin, 40, has pleaded guilty to filing a false tax return.</p>
<p>From 2012 to 2015, Levin operated Glebova Realty Group. This group purchased, renovated and sold real estate throughout the Buffalo, N.Y., area. During those years, Levin did file federal income tax returns. However, he failed to accurately report the gross receipts that he earned from his real estate business to the IRS. As you might assume, he also failed to pay taxes on such income. He caused more than $3.1 million of gross receipts from his real estate business to be excluded from his returns. This resulted in a tax loss of $161,606.</p>
<h6>The Sentencing</h6>
<p>The charge carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a $250,000 fine.</p>
<h4><strong>Waialua, Hawaii</strong></h4>
<p>The court convicted Preparer Guillermo Dahilig of aiding and assisting in the preparation and filing of false returns. The court sentenced him 18 months in prison. <img class="alignright  wp-image-2456" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/7-Recent-Tax-Cases-You’ll-Enjoy-Reading-About-cars-crowd-daylight.jpg" alt="7 Recent Tax Cases You’ll Enjoy Reading About, cars, crowd, daylight" width="263" height="249" /></p>
<p>According to court documents and case information, from 2009 to 2016 Dahilig owned and operated Speedy Gill Services, an Oahu tax prep business. He prepared 750 to 1,000 returns per year for clients and charged $100 to $200 per return. To inflate refunds, he falsified clients’ returns with deductions for items such as medical expenses, personal property tax, job expenses and charitable contributions that he knew were greater than the figures provided by his clients. From at least 2010 through 2013, he also underreported the income of Speedy Gill on the returns he prepared and filed for himself and his wife.</p>
<p>Following his incarceration, Dahilig will be on supervised release for a year. They&#8217;ve also ordered him to pay $318,222 in restitution to the IRS.</p>
<h4><strong>New York </strong></h4>
<p>CPA and attorney Steven Etkind has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the U.S. and tax evasion arising from a scheme to embezzle millions from a deceased client’s estate.</p>
<p>According to court documents and statements in court, Etkind was a partner at a New York law firm’s tax, trusts and estates group. He performed legal work for a successful entrepreneur client. The client then died in 2008, naming Etkind as the co-executor of his $35 million estate.</p>
<p>The client’s will directed the creation of two charitable trust private foundations, funded with assets from the client’s estate, for the sole purpose of donating to 501(c)(3) organizations, including those aimed at assisting Jewish-sponsored organizations. Etkind was the co-trustee of these trusts.</p>
<h6>The Background</h6>
<p>Beginning in 2009, Etkind and his co-conspirator set up a phony charitable organization, the United Jewish Education Foundation, and used it to steal more than $3.5 million from these charitable trusts. Then, Etkind directed that donations from the trusts be first made to legitimate Jewish charitable organizations to give the disbursements the appearance of legitimate donations. The criminal and his co-conspirator then redirected the funds to accounts of the UJEF, the phony charity that his co-conspirator controlled.</p>
<p>Etkind subsequently directed his co-conspirator to write checks, totaling $327,500, to a bank account in the name of JE Capital Holding Corp., a nominee corporate entity that Etkind controlled exclusively. He further directed more than $3 million to be used in 2010 to purchase a 6,300 square-foot home with a swimming pool in Southampton, N.Y. Etkind later transferred title of the property to JE Trust, a nominee trust he controlled.</p>
<p>Etkind filed and caused to be filed fraudulent personal, corporate and charitable trust returns with the IRS. This was solely to conceal his embezzlement. During a subsequent IRS audit of UJEF, Etkind and his co-conspirator made several false and misleading statements, including about the true ownership of the Southampton property.</p>
<h6>The Sentencing</h6>
<p>Sentencing is Jan. 18. Etkind faces a maximum of five years in prison on the conspiracy charge and five years for tax evasion. He also faces a period of supervised release, restitution, and monetary penalties.</p>
<h4><strong>Ft. Myers, Fla.</strong></h4>
<p>Resident Attila Kalmar has been sentenced to 18 months in prison. Get this: he was stealing government funds and endeavoring to obstruct internal revenue laws. According to court documents, Kalmar filed 2007 through 2009 trust returns with the IRS in the name of First AK-Open Sec Trust, a nominee entity, seeking more than $480,000 in fraudulent refunds. He deposited a refund check he received as a result of these filings into a bank account. Afterward, he used the proceeds to purchase real property, acquire thousands of dollars in gold coins and wire money overseas.</p>
<p>He tried to impede the internal revenue laws by transferring funds between nominee bank accounts. Also, he falsely represented to the IRS that an IRS revenue officer was the trustee for First AK-Open Sec Trust.</p>
<h6>The Sentencing</h6>
<p>In addition to the term of prison imposed, the courts ordered Kalmar to serve three years of supervised release. He forfeited $274,019, a piece of real estate to the U.S. and paid $274,019 in restitution to the IRS.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>IRS Warns Taxpayers to be Alert for Scams Related to Natural Disasters</strong></h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk tax scams. According to the IRS, some scammers impersonate charities or operate bogus charities to get money or private information from well-intentioned taxpayers. For example, some have bogus websites which use names similar to legitimate charities to trick people to send money or provide personal financial information.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-1912" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/irs-warns-of-scams-due-to-natural-disasters-cops-clay-scammers.jpg" alt="irs warns of scams due to natural disasters, cops, clay, scammers" width="330" height="226" /></p>
<p>It doesn’t stop with just fake charities, though. Some scammers will reach out directly to taxpayers, claiming to be working for or on behalf of the IRS to help storm victims file casualty loss claims and get tax refunds. However, the IRS <em>will not</em> initiate contact with you by email (or phone) to discuss your tax account.</p>
<p>As the Carolinas continue recovering after Hurricane Florence, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has issued a <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-warns-of-scams-related-to-natural-disasters">reminder</a> to taxpayers that criminals and scammers will try to take advantage of the generosity of taxpayers who want to help and “undoubtedly pop up when [the] hurricane occurs.”</p>
<h3><strong>How it Starts</strong></h3>
<p>Fake charity-related scams usually start with some form of unsolicited contact. Usually, this would be a telephone call, social media post or message, e-mail or even an in-person visit. Successful scam calls lead to phishing schemes, identity theft or financial loss. <img class="alignright  wp-image-1913" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/irs-warns-of-scams-due-to-natural-disasters-clouds-fire-red.jpg" alt="irs warns of scams due to natural disasters, clouds, fire, red" width="349" height="193" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Some impersonate charities to get money or private information from well-intentioned taxpayers.</li>
<li>Bogus websites use names similar to legitimate charities to trick people to send money, or provide personal financial information.</li>
<li>Sometimes, they even claim to be working for or on behalf of the IRS to help victims file casualty loss claims and get tax refunds.</li>
<li>Others operate bogus charities and solicit money or financial information by telephone or email.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, the IRS compiles a list known as the “Dirty Dozen”, and it’s not the least bit surprising that the fraudulent schemes involving fake charities winded up on there this year. They’re persuasive. The Dirty Dozen is compiled annually by the IRS and lists a variety of common scams taxpayers may encounter any time during the year. Check out more of the schemes <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2018/03/22/irs-warns-on-dirty-dozen-tax-scams/">here</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Donations</strong></h3>
<p>Finally, if you’re looking to donate, go through established channels like qualified charitable organizations. You can find more tips about charities offering assistance to Florence victims, and what to look for, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2018/09/16/helping-out-after-hurricane-florence-where-what--how-to-donate/#5dcba9667c55">here</a>.</p>

<h2><strong>I have an overseas account, but I didn’t think about this!</strong></h2>
<p>If you have a foreign account, you have until April 15 to file a FINCEN 114 form electronically (formally FBAR) with the Treasury&#8217;s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network if you had interest in or signature authority over at least one account outside of the U.S., and the aggregate value of all the foreign accounts exceeded $10,000 at any time in the year (even for an hour).  However, in its infinite wisdom, the US Treasury allows for a 6 month extension – but no form has been created (unlike for other filings), so it’s an automatic extension.</p>
<p>Also, if you meet certain thresholds, a form has to be included with your income tax return.</p>
<p>Single filers who reside in the U.S. must submit Fact Form 8938 if the total value of their foreign financial assets exceeds $50,000 on the last day of the tax year ($100,000 for joint filers) or if the value exceeds $75,000 at any time during the year ($150,000 for couples filing jointly).</p>
<h2><strong>Keeping secrets? Not from the IRS, we hope. </strong></h2>
<p><img class=" wp-image-1769 alignright" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IRS-Forces-Full-Disclosure-for-Overseas-Accounts-tea-table-interesting.jpg" alt="" width="295" height="296" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IRS-Forces-Full-Disclosure-for-Overseas-Accounts-tea-table-interesting-150x150.jpg 150w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IRS-Forces-Full-Disclosure-for-Overseas-Accounts-tea-table-interesting-570x570.jpg 570w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IRS-Forces-Full-Disclosure-for-Overseas-Accounts-tea-table-interesting-500x500.jpg 500w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IRS-Forces-Full-Disclosure-for-Overseas-Accounts-tea-table-interesting-1000x1000.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 295px) 100vw, 295px" /></p>
<p>There are tons of people that have accounts overseas, for reasons both good and bad. Overseas bank accounts give account holders opportunities to invest internationally and guarantee international medical coverage! There are lots of perks with seeking international monetary safekeeping.</p>
<p>For example, you have parents who were born – and still live – overseas that you help to support. Their bank only has branches in that country. You wire money to that account from your bank here in the U.S.  You are technically on that account, even just as a signatory. On January 25<sup>th</sup>, you deposit $5,000 in that account that already has $5,500 USD in it. Then one day, your parents withdraw $10,400 USD to pay for something. That account never again has more than $10,000 in it. You still have a FINCEN 114 filing requirement.</p>
<p>If you are not declaring business receipts and keeping an account a secret, you’re taking illegal measures to keep tax-triggering facts and events secret. The IRS figured it out and is taking appropriate measures to collect their dues.</p>
<h2><strong>What if I Didn’t Report This?</strong></h2>
<p>You’ll be okay. For now. We can help you fill out a streamlined filing compliance and get you up-to-date if you weren’t aware of your filing obligations. There are 65,000 people who have jumped on this opportunity so far, but it won’t last forever.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-1770 alignleft" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IRS-Forces-Full-Disclosure-for-Overseas-Accounts-man-drinking-coffee-reading-newspaper.jpg" alt="" width="176" height="254" /></p>
<p>If you fail to disclose these amounts, you could face a penalty of up to $10,000. If you continue to withhold the information even after the IRS notifies you of a failure to disclose, you may face a maximum penalty of $60,000, along with potential criminal penalties.</p>
<p>You don’t want to face the consequences associated with missing the reporting requirement – you may lose $100,000 or even 50% of what you’ve put in that bank account (assuming it’s a lot, people don’t typically open these without serious reasoning.) Set up a consultation as soon as you can to meet with an enrolled agent – like Jeffrey Schneider, EA, CTRS.</p>
<p>On September 28<sup>th</sup>, the IRS is shutting down its voluntary disclosure program. Those who have failed to report their overseas accounts could be subject to large fines, penalties, and criminal prosecution. As it turns out, more than 56,000 taxpayers stepped up to the plate after the program began in 2009 to report their foreign financial assets; they had to pay <strong>$11.1 billion</strong> in back taxes, interest, and penalties.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’ve had a big tax debt at the end of last year, your Enrolled Agent may have talked with you about paying estimated taxes, especially if you are self-employed.</p>
<p>Hopefully, your eyes didn’t roll into your head and you didn’t tune him or her out.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>If you do not make them, and you do not pay them, you can get slapped with a penalty.</p>
<p>And if you don’t pay them, and you owe with the return and do not pay the tax then, eventually the IRS will initiate collection activity.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s the catch, though…</strong></p>
<p>Not everyone has to pay estimated taxes. And, if your tax situation changes, you may not know until the end of the year that you should have paid them (or made adjustments to your withholding amounts).</p>
<p>Confusing? It can be. Here’s the breakdown.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1477 aligncenter" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/What-Happens-if-You-Dont-Pay-Estimated-Taxes-SFS-Tax-Problem-SolutionsPocket-Watch-wood-table-watch-face-antique-watch-300x199.png" alt="" width="300" height="199" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/What-Happens-if-You-Dont-Pay-Estimated-Taxes-SFS-Tax-Problem-SolutionsPocket-Watch-wood-table-watch-face-antique-watch-300x199.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/What-Happens-if-You-Dont-Pay-Estimated-Taxes-SFS-Tax-Problem-SolutionsPocket-Watch-wood-table-watch-face-antique-watch.png 472w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p><strong>We are a pay-as-you-go system. </strong></p>
<p>You must pay what you owe in taxes <em>as you receive your income</em>.</p>
<p>The trouble is that, if you are a sole proprietor, business owner, or independent contractor, you may not know what your income, expenses, deductions and (in some cases) tax bracket until after the end of the year.</p>
<p>For you, instead of having the actual numbers to rely on, you will need to estimate what your income will be as well as what your expenses and other tax deductions (standard or itemized) will be.</p>
<p>Using this information, you can get an idea of your estimated taxes.</p>
<p><strong>Enter a Monkey Wrench</strong></p>
<p>The new Tax Cuts and Jobs Act changed the laws about many deductions – from almost doubling the standard deduction to putting a $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions.</p>
<p>This can make it difficult to know where you stand.</p>
<p>Because of the new laws, even those with a steady paycheck may not be withholding enough or, conversely, may be handing over too much of an interest-free loan to the government with every paycheck.</p>
<p><strong>There are Penalties at Stake</strong></p>
<p>You probably know that if you don’t pay the right amount of tax, you can get slapped with a penalty… and interest.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you don’t pay your taxes on a timely basis (meaning as you earn income throughout the year) you can get slapped with penalties as well.</p>
<p>Funny though… there is absolutely no penalty for overpaying your taxes. Of course, you are robbing yourself of interest-earning potential on those extra dollars you handed over. Not to mention you could have used that money when the car broke down (or you got sick, or your new puppy chewed up your favorite pair of shoes).</p>
<p><strong>So What can You Do? </strong></p>
<p>Take heart, there is a way to CYA (Cover Your Assets).</p>
<p>You can, generally, do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pay 90% of this year’s tax bill before the tax deadline, or </strong></li>
<li><strong>Pay 100% of last year’s tax bill (also before the deadline)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The estimated taxes are due April 15<sup>th</sup>, June 15<sup>th</sup>, September 15<sup>th</sup>, and January 15<sup>th</sup> (weekends and holidays not considered).</p>
<p>Another option is to get in touch with an Enrolled Agent who can help make sure you pay the right amount (and only the right amount) of tax at the right time. He or she can also utilize his or her knowledge and expertise to plan your financial moves with an eye toward minimizing your tax bill.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sNgZFxAnKtA?rel=0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>Remember the Calgon commercials of the 1970s and 1980s? Those of you who were around that is…</p>
<p>A harried woman juggling kids, housework, jobs, and life, in general, gets fed up and utters the magic phrase:</p>
<p><em>“Calgon, take me away!” </em></p>
<p>Immediately, she is whisked away to a luxurious bubble bath, where all her cares appear to melt away.</p>
<p>Sounds pretty good, doesn’t it?</p>
<p>It resonated with its target audience and is still one of the most iconic commercials of all time.</p>
<p>The sentiment is just as true today as it was back then.</p>
<h3><strong>Life Gets Overwhelming… and We Just Want It to All Go Away! </strong></h3>
<p>With taxes though, that’s really not a good strategy.</p>
<p>As much of a pain in the rear as they can be, we need to address them.</p>
<p>Still, some people choose to ignore these tax deadlines and notices.</p>
<p>They are hoping to wake up in a beautiful bubble bath, perhaps?</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WVf1lClfBng?rel=0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>What Happens if You Ignore Your Taxes?</p>
<p>Nothing would happen… at first.</p>
<p>Let’s say you don’t file your taxes on April 15th (or 17th, or whatever the deadline happens to be).<br />
You aren’t likely to have a SWAT team show up at your door, ready to take you down, the very next day.</p>
<p>It may take a while for the IRS to realize you are a non-filer.</p>
<p>In fact, some people think that if they don’t file their tax return and nothing happens for 10 years, they are magically off the hook.</p>
<p>They may have heard that the IRS has only 10 years to collect (and that’s a long time, by the way)! Yes, that’s true.</p>
<p>But the clock doesn’t start ticking until a return is filed.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-1404 alignleft" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Wishing-it-Would-All-Go-Away-Doesnt-Work-with-the-IRS-SFS-Tax-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Woman-Bubbly-Water-300x179.png" alt="Wishing it Would All Go Away Doesnt Work with the IRS, SFS Tax, SFS Tax Problem Solutions, Woman, Bubbly Water" width="300" height="179" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Wishing-it-Would-All-Go-Away-Doesnt-Work-with-the-IRS-SFS-Tax-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Woman-Bubbly-Water-300x179.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Wishing-it-Would-All-Go-Away-Doesnt-Work-with-the-IRS-SFS-Tax-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Woman-Bubbly-Water-768x458.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Wishing-it-Would-All-Go-Away-Doesnt-Work-with-the-IRS-SFS-Tax-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Woman-Bubbly-Water-700x418.png 700w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Wishing-it-Would-All-Go-Away-Doesnt-Work-with-the-IRS-SFS-Tax-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Woman-Bubbly-Water.png 846w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<h3><strong>Here’s How You Can Rack Up a Huge Tax Bill without Even Knowing It </strong></h3>
<p>If you don’t file a tax return yourself, the IRS is able to create one for you, known as a Substitute for Return (SFR).</p>
<p>Let’s say you live under a rock (or in a large bubble bath, albeit with very wrinkly skin by this point) for 15 years without filing a return. One day the IRS finally wakes up to this and files SFRs for you, for each of those 15 years.</p>
<p>Guess what?</p>
<p>Any tax you owe will be subject to whopping interest and penalties as well.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-1405 alignright" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Wishing-it-Would-All-Go-Away-Doesnt-Work-with-the-IRS-SFS-Tax-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Rubber-Ducky-300x222.png" alt="Wishing it Would All Go Away Doesnt Work with the IRS, SFS Tax, SFS Tax Problem Solutions, Rubber Ducky" width="300" height="222" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Wishing-it-Would-All-Go-Away-Doesnt-Work-with-the-IRS-SFS-Tax-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Rubber-Ducky-300x222.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Wishing-it-Would-All-Go-Away-Doesnt-Work-with-the-IRS-SFS-Tax-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Rubber-Ducky.png 686w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<h3><strong>Do Yourself a Favor and Start Taking Steps to Get Right with the IRS Today</strong></h3>
<p>Just be aware that it’s not the IRS’s responsibility to look out for you.</p>
<p>They won’t, for example, make sure you take advantage of all the ways you can legitimately lower your tax bill.</p>
<p>An Enrolled Agent (EA) will though!</p>
<p>That’s why, if you’re hiding out now, you’ll likely need to expert advice of a trained EA to ensure that you don’t get soaked.</p>
