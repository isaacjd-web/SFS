								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sNgZFxAnKtA?rel=0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>Remember the Calgon commercials of the 1970s and 1980s? Those of you who were around that is…</p>
<p>A harried woman juggling kids, housework, jobs, and life, in general, gets fed up and utters the magic phrase:</p>
<p><em>“Calgon, take me away!” </em></p>
<p>Immediately, she is whisked away to a luxurious bubble bath, where all her cares appear to melt away.</p>
<p>Sounds pretty good, doesn’t it?</p>
<p>It resonated with its target audience and is still one of the most iconic commercials of all time.</p>
<p>The sentiment is just as true today as it was back then.</p>
<h3><strong>Life Gets Overwhelming… and We Just Want It to All Go Away! </strong></h3>
<p>With taxes though, that’s really not a good strategy.</p>
<p>As much of a pain in the rear as they can be, we need to address them.</p>
<p>Still, some people choose to ignore these tax deadlines and notices.</p>
<p>They are hoping to wake up in a beautiful bubble bath, perhaps?</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WVf1lClfBng?rel=0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>What Happens if You Ignore Your Taxes?</p>
<p>Nothing would happen… at first.</p>
<p>Let’s say you don’t file your taxes on April 15th (or 17th, or whatever the deadline happens to be).<br />
You aren’t likely to have a SWAT team show up at your door, ready to take you down, the very next day.</p>
<p>It may take a while for the IRS to realize you are a non-filer.</p>
<p>In fact, some people think that if they don’t file their tax return and nothing happens for 10 years, they are magically off the hook.</p>
<p>They may have heard that the IRS has only 10 years to collect (and that’s a long time, by the way)! Yes, that’s true.</p>
<p>But the clock doesn’t start ticking until a return is filed.</p>

<h3><strong>Here’s How You Can Rack Up a Huge Tax Bill without Even Knowing It </strong></h3>
<p>If you don’t file a tax return yourself, the IRS is able to create one for you, known as a Substitute for Return (SFR).</p>
<p>Let’s say you live under a rock (or in a large bubble bath, albeit with very wrinkly skin by this point) for 15 years without filing a return. One day the IRS finally wakes up to this and files SFRs for you, for each of those 15 years.</p>
<p>Guess what?</p>
<p>Any tax you owe will be subject to whopping interest and penalties as well.</p>

<h3><strong>Do Yourself a Favor and Start Taking Steps to Get Right with the IRS Today</strong></h3>
<p>Just be aware that it’s not the IRS’s responsibility to look out for you.</p>
<p>They won’t, for example, make sure you take advantage of all the ways you can legitimately lower your tax bill.</p>
<p>An Enrolled Agent (EA) will though!</p>
<p>That’s why, if you’re hiding out now, you’ll likely need to expert advice of a trained EA to ensure that you don’t get soaked.</p>
