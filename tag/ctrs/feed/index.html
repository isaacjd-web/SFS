								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: left;">What Do I Do? I Didn’t Report My Crypto Trades On Prior Year&#8217;s Tax Return?</h5>
<p>In 2014 the IRS determined that cryptocurrency was property for tax purposes. There are well-established rules for how to treat property in place. However, many people aren&#8217;t disclosing their cryptocurrency transactions. If you were buying and selling cryptocurrency at any point in the past few years, you needed to report these transactions on your annual tax return.</p>
<p>The IRS has ramped up its efforts to go after those that did not correctly report their cryptocurrency-trading on prior years&#8217; tax returns.</p>
<p>Back in the summer of 2019, the IRS mailed some 10,000 letters to crypto account owners to educate crypto account holders about the rules.  And tell taxpayers to review their tax reporting for crypto transactions to be sure they reported income correctly.</p>
<p>Forbes published an article on July 31, 2019, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2019/07/31/watch-out-cryptocurrency-owners-the-irs-is-on-the-hunt/#3d2e522d6990">Watch Out Cryptocurrency Owners, The IRS Is On The Hunt.</a> The article explained the letters traders received from the IRS. It stated that &#8220;The IRS might know there is unreported income based on tax information obtained through enforcement actions, which include the summons against U.S. Coinbase customers. You received the letter because you didn&#8217;t file a tax return, which should have included virtual currency transactions. Alternatively, you filed a return but did not report virtual currency transactions. You must reply to this tax notice by submitting a correct late tax return or an amended return.&#8221; They further went on to state that &#8220;Letter 6173 is a severe tax notice, and you should not dig yourself into a bigger hole with an incorrect reply. In some cases, perjury could be a felony. The letter states, &#8220;If we don&#8217;t hear from you by the &#8220;respond by&#8221; date, we may refer your tax account for examination.&#8221;</p>
<p>The IRS advised, “Taxpayers who do not properly report the income tax consequences of virtual currency transactions are, when appropriate, liable for tax, penalties, and interest. In some cases, taxpayers could be subject to criminal prosecution.”</p>
<p>On October 6, the IRS released a ruling with guidance for cryptocurrency holders. They also sent out correspondences advising virtual currency owners to pay their back taxes. If you received a letter from the IRS, you should consult with me immediately.</p>
<p>I am an Advanced Crypto Tax Expert (ACT-E) and specially trained to help taxpayers resolve any outstanding issue to your incorrectly filed tax returns.  <img class="alignright wp-image-2533" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ACT-E-designation-1-300x257.png" alt="Advanced Crypto Expert designation" width="256" height="219" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ACT-E-designation-1-300x257.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ACT-E-designation-1.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px" /></p>
<h5 style="text-align: left;">I didn’t report my crypto trades on my prior year&#8217;s tax return? What do I do?</h5>
<p style="text-align: left;">Did you know that the IRS can go back up to three years to prosecute cases of tax evasion, and in cases where they find significant errors, they can go back up to six years or more? Many crypto investors and traders are concerned about getting audited and having a future tax liability that they can’t afford. The solution to this potential problem is to be proactive and amend your previous years’ return.</p>
<p>What should you do if you already filed your tax return and didn’t report your cryptocurrency gains on that return? Amend your tax return for whichever year(s) you didn’t report your crypto trades. You have three years from the date that you filed your return to file an amended return. The IRS is more forgiving to those who make a good-faith effort to pay their taxes.</p>
<p>To accurately calculate how much money you owe in capital gains, you have to know what the Fair Market Value of the cryptocurrency was at the time of the trade. For traders who have executed hundreds, if not thousands of trades over the years, this can be a daunting task.</p>
<p>As an ACT-E, I have the specific expertise to help taxpayers who didn’t report all of their crypto gains get back on track. We can amend both federal and state income tax returns to report missing crypto gains or other income.</p>
<p>However,  the past three years of tax returns should be amended, but depending on the exact circumstances, a more extended period might be necessary. I can help you assess your current situation and determine how many years you need to amend.

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>$458 Owed in Back Taxes&#8230;The IRS Are On Their Way!</strong></h2>
<p>If you thought you were getting away from the IRS before… apparently so did everybody else. The IRS is on a mission to collect nearly $500 billion owed in back taxes, and they’re not going to stop until they get every penny.</p>
<p>And get this – if you still run and hide – interest now accrues DAILY, not monthly!</p>
<h4><strong>What does this MEAN?</strong></h4>
<p><img class="wp-image-1697 alignleft" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/458-Billion-Debt-Owed-The-IRS-Are-on-Their-Way-chaos-paperwork-man-giving-up.jpg" alt="" width="169" height="234" /></p>
<p>“You’re paying interest on interest on interest every day,” said IRS national taxpayer advocate Nina Olson. “The worst thing you can do if you have a debt is do nothing at all.”</p>
<p>It may be time to meet with an Enrolled Agent to review your federal tax payments. An experienced EA can pull your IRS transcripts, analyze the findings, and let you know where you stand.</p>
<p>The IRS has much more power than ever before. In fact, Pete Sepp – president of the <a href="https://www.ntu.org/">National Taxpayers Union</a> &#8211; claims, “The IRS has a huge suite of tools to get taxpayers to pay back taxes and some of those tools are very blunt.”</p>
<h4><strong>What will they DO?</strong></h4>
<p>The IRS WILL seize property, garnish your wages and take legal action by all means necessary.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-1696 alignright" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/458-Billion-Debt-Owed-The-IRS-are-on-their-way-passport-revoked-travel-irs.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="210" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/458-Billion-Debt-Owed-The-IRS-are-on-their-way-passport-revoked-travel-irs.jpg 4000w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/458-Billion-Debt-Owed-The-IRS-are-on-their-way-passport-revoked-travel-irs-300x209.jpg 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/458-Billion-Debt-Owed-The-IRS-are-on-their-way-passport-revoked-travel-irs-768x536.jpg 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/458-Billion-Debt-Owed-The-IRS-are-on-their-way-passport-revoked-travel-irs-1024x715.jpg 1024w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/458-Billion-Debt-Owed-The-IRS-are-on-their-way-passport-revoked-travel-irs-700x489.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>It’s definitely time to be proactive (if we can even still use that word). Have you heard about the IRS’s new <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2018-07-06/hundreds-of-thousands-at-risk-for-passport-denial-because-of-tax-debt">passport revocation abilities</a>? We have learned that around 362,000 Americans with unpaid tax debts will not be able to apply for or renew passports until their debts are settled. The law now actually <strong>requires</strong> the IRS and the State to deny or revoke passports for people who have an overdue tax debt of $51k or more.</p>
<h4><strong>How do I fix this?</strong></h4>
<p>Fixing your debts becomes absolutely crucial when the IRS holds as much power as they now do. Contact your <a href="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/media/">enrolled agent</a>; they have the means necessary to fix your tax and debt issues before things begin to get messy.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">Mail, Phone, Email or Facebook&#8230;How Does the IRS Contact Taxpayers? When the IRS needs to contact a taxpayer, the first contact is normally by letter delivered by the U.S. Postal Service. The IRS doesn&#8217;t normally initiate contact with taxpayers by email, nor does it send text messages or contact through social media channels.</p>
<p class="p1">Depending on the situation, IRS employees may first call or visit with a taxpayer. In some instances, advance notice is provided in writing via a letter or notice, but not always.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>IRS Phone Calls</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">IRS revenue officers work directly with taxpayers to educate them about their options to resolve delinquencies and to collect delinquent taxes and tax returns while protecting taxpayers&#8217; rights.</li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1"> </span>IRS revenue agents or tax compliance officers may call a taxpayer or tax professional after mailing a notice to confirm an appointment or to discuss items for a scheduled audit.</li>
<li class="li1">Private debt collectors can call taxpayers for the collection of certain outstanding inactive tax liabilities but only after the taxpayer and their representative have received written notice. <span class="s2">Private debt collectors</span> for the IRS must respect taxpayers&#8217; rights and abide by the consumer protection provisions of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><b>IRS Visits</b></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span>IRS revenue officers routinely make unannounced visits to a taxpayer’s home or place of business to discuss taxes owed, delinquent tax returns or a business falling behind on payroll tax deposits. IRS revenue officers will request payment of taxes owed by the taxpayer; however, payment will never be requested to a source other than the US Treasury.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1"> </span>IRS revenue agents usually visit taxpayers or tax professionals to conduct the audit after either mailing a notice and/or agreeing on the day and time. IRS revenue agents will sometimes make unannounced visits to a taxpayer’s home or place of business to discuss a tax matter.</li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1"> </span>IRS criminal investigators are federal law enforcement agents who may visit a taxpayer’s home or place of business unannounced while conducting an investigation. They will not demand any sort of payment.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><b>Ask For Credentials</b></p>
<p class="p1">IRS representatives can always provide two forms of official credentials: a pocket commission and a <a href="http://links.govdelivery.com:80/track?type=click&amp;enid=ZWFzPTEmbWFpbGluZ2lkPTIwMTcwODAyLjc2NTc0NjYxJm1lc3NhZ2VpZD1NREItUFJELUJVTC0yMDE3MDgwMi43NjU3NDY2MSZkYXRhYmFzZWlkPTEwMDEmc2VyaWFsPTE3MTQ5NTIwJmVtYWlsaWQ9YWxpQHNmc3RheGFjY3QuY29tJnVzZXJpZD1hbGlAc2ZzdGF4YWNjdC5jb20mZmw9JmV4dHJhPU11bHRpdmFyaWF0ZUlkPSYmJg==&amp;&amp;&amp;129&amp;&amp;&amp;https://www.fedidcard.gov/"><span class="s2">Personal Identity Verification Credential (PIV)</span></a>. Pocket commissions describe the specific authority and responsibilities of the authorized holder. The PIV is a government-wide standard for secure and reliable forms of identification for federal employees and contractors. Criminal investigators also have a badge and law enforcement credentials.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Paying Taxes</b></p>
<p class="p1">All tax payments are to the U.S. Treasury. Taxpayers should never use a preloaded debit card or wire transfer to make a payment. The IRS provides specific guidelines on how to make a tax payment at <a href="http://links.govdelivery.com:80/track?type=click&amp;enid=ZWFzPTEmbWFpbGluZ2lkPTIwMTcwODAyLjc2NTc0NjYxJm1lc3NhZ2VpZD1NREItUFJELUJVTC0yMDE3MDgwMi43NjU3NDY2MSZkYXRhYmFzZWlkPTEwMDEmc2VyaWFsPTE3MTQ5NTIwJmVtYWlsaWQ9YWxpQHNmc3RheGFjY3QuY29tJnVzZXJpZD1hbGlAc2ZzdGF4YWNjdC5jb20mZmw9JmV4dHJhPU11bHRpdmFyaWF0ZUlkPSYmJg==&amp;&amp;&amp;130&amp;&amp;&amp;https://www.irs.gov/payments"><span class="s2">irs.gov/payments</span></a>.</p>
<p class="p1">IRS employees and contractors will never:</p>
<p><span class="s1">g• </span>Be hostile or insulting</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">Demand payment without giving taxpayers the opportunity to question or appeal the amount</li>
<li class="li1">Require a specific payment method, such as a prepaid debit card</li>
<li class="li1">Threaten lawsuits, arrest, deportation or other action for not paying</li>
<li class="li1">Ask for credit or debit card numbers over the phone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mail, Phone, Email or Facebook&#8230;How Does the IRS Contact Taxpayers? If you have any questions call your tax professional or reach out to Jeffrey Schneider, EA, CTRS, NTPIF at SFS Tax Problem Solutions</p>
<p class="p1">Avoid scams. The IRS never initiates contact using social media or text messages.
