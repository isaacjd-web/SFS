								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You’ve probably heard someone who represents himself has a fool for a client. This is just as true when it comes to the IRS as it is in a criminal court.</p>
<p>If you’re in trouble with the IRS, you need an Enrolled Agent. Here’s why:</p>
<h2><strong>Enrolled Agent is the Highest Credential Issued by the IRS</strong></h2>
<p>Enrolled agents are the only federally licensed tax practitioners who specialize in taxation and can represent clients before all levels of the IRS.</p>
<p>They can also represent taxpayers – businesses or individuals – in any state and in any tax matter.</p>
<p>The Enrolled Agent (EA) is the most expansive license the IRS grants.</p>
<p>There’s no substitute for an EA!</p>

Here's What You Need" width="477" height="318" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cable-call-communication-33999-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cable-call-communication-33999-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cable-call-communication-33999-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cable-call-communication-33999-1-700x467.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 477px) 100vw, 477px" />Enrolled Agents have the Expertise You Need</strong></h3>
<p>EAs face stringent qualifications to earn their designation.</p>
<p>Candidates must pass a rigorous background check, conducted by the IRS.</p>
<p>They have to either have been employed by the IRS for five years or pass the SEE (Special Enrollment Exam). This three-part, comprehensive tax code test is administered by the <a href="https://www.naea.org/">National Association of Enrolled Agents (NAEA)</a>. It covers individual and business tax returns, tax representation and practice and procedure.</p>
<p>Enrolled agents have gone beyond the basic tax preparer requirements. They have demonstrated expertise in the field of taxes.</p>
<h3><strong>Enrolled Agents Stay Current on the Ever-Changing Tax Laws</strong></h3>
<p>EAs must also complete 72 hours of education courses every three years.</p>
<p>Members of the NAEA face an even higher standard. They must complete 90 hours each three year period.</p>
<p>Attorneys and CPAs may or may not specialize in taxation. All Enrolled Agents do.</p>
<p>EAs eat, breathe and live taxes!</p>
<h3><strong>Enrolled Agents who are Members of the NAEA adhere to a Code of Ethics</strong></h3>
<p>NAEA members must adhere to a stringent Code of Ethics and Rules of Professional Conduct. They belong to a strong network of experienced, well-trained tax professionals, effectively representing their clients and working to make the tax code fair and reasonably enforced.</p>
