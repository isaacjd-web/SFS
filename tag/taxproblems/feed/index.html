<h2 style="text-align: center;">Oh No! The IRS Sent a Tax Notice</h2>
<p>The moment you take an IRS Notice from your mailbox, it&#8217;s time to open it and call an enrolled agent immediately. A tax professional will be able to guide you through the process of resolving your tax problem and place you in the best possible light in front of the IRS.</p>
<h2><strong>The Scary Stuff</strong></h2>
<p>If you don’t take action now, the IRS &#8211; which is the world’s largest and most aggressive collection agency &#8211; could cause incredible hardships down the road. You can&#8217;t bury your head in the sand once you receive the notice. Have you heard of tax liens and tax levies? The IRS uses these two methods to collect their dues. Taxpayers must fix their problems quickly and voluntarily.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Tax Liens</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">A tax lien is a claim on your property. If your tax debt exceeds $10,000, the IRS issues a &#8220;secret – or silent &#8211; lien&#8221; because even though at first there is no public record, it attaches to all of your property and rights to property — both real estate and personal property — as of the date the tax is assessed.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For example, a tax is assessed against you on July 1st and you give the property to a third party as a gift on July 2nd. The tax lien continues to be attached to that property, even though you had no prior knowledge of the existence of the tax lien. The person who received the property didn&#8217;t know that the tax lien had arisen!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wp-image-1841 alignleft" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/What-to-do-when-the-IRS-sends-a-tax-notice-bank-conference-crisis-financial-debt.jpg" alt="" width="366" height="227" />When most taxpayers or tax professionals refer to a tax lien, they are actually referring to a &#8220;Notice of Federal Tax Lien&#8221; (NFTL). An NFTL is a document filed in a public place, such as a county recorder&#8217;s office or with the Secretary of State. It is a notice to the world that you owe taxes. A Notice of Federal Tax Lien lists the amount of the taxes owed, the type of tax, and even the years for which taxes are owed.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Notice of Federal Tax Lien may even be picked up by the various credit reporting agencies, and may cause significant credit problems. At this point, don&#8217;t sell any property you own. Your property equity will go directly to the IRS.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Tax Levies</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">A levy is the IRS collecting a debt you owe through the seizure of your property; be it cash (bank) or wages (garnishment). A tax levy is not available for the general public to see. It also does not affect your credit rating by itself or prevent you from selling your property. However, if the IRS serves a tax levy on your bank, the bank is <strong>required</strong> to send all your money to the IRS up to the amount of the tax debt. The bank will then notify you of its receipt of the tax levy. After that, you&#8217;ll have 21 calendar days to negotiate with the IRS to try and convince them to release it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If the IRS sends a tax levy to your employer, your employer is required to send the required amount to the IRS and because there is no 21-day holding period, the tax levy is effective starting with the very first paycheck you receive after the employer receives the tax levy. In addition, there is no holding period. If you find out the IRS has served a tax levy on your employer, it is extremely important to contact a qualified enrolled agent. He or she will begin immediate negotiations with your employer before your next paycheck. Your bank and your employer will forward your money to the IRS. Once that happens, it is very hard to get them back.</p>
<h5><em>An Impeding Feeling of Doom</em></h5>
<p>The IRS can seize assets such as wages, bank accounts, social security benefits, and retirement income. The IRS may also seize and sell your property to satisfy the tax debt. This includes your car, boat, real estate, etc. <em>Ouch.</em> In addition, any future federal tax refunds will be used to pay off the debt. Even state income tax refunds that you&#8217;re due may be seized and applied to your federal tax liability.<br />
If the IRS sent a tax notice, it’s absolutely crucial that you get help from an enrolled agent. He or she will help you move forward and prevent the IRS from creating such hardships.</p>
<h2><strong>A Fresh Start for All</strong><img class="wp-image-1842 alignright" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/What-to-do-when-the-IRS-sends-a-tax-notice-girl-jumping-fence-happy.jpg" alt="" width="386" height="233" /></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/new-irs-fresh-start-initiative-helps-taxpayers-who-owe-taxes">IRS Fresh Start program</a> makes it easier for taxpayers and even small businesses to pay back taxes and avoid tax liens. If the IRS sent a tax notice, you should know the features of and consider the Fresh Start program:</p>
<h5>• <strong>Tax Liens</strong></h5>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Fresh Start program increased the amount that taxpayers can owe to $10,000. The IRS generally will file a Notice of Federal Tax Lien once the taxpayer surpasses that. However, in some cases, the IRS may still file a lien notice on amounts less than $10,000.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Some taxpayers may qualify to have their lien notice withdrawn if they are paying their tax debt through a Direct Debit Installment Agreement. However, if a taxpayer defaults on the Direct Debit Installment Agreement, the IRS may file a new Notice of Federal Tax Lien and resume collection actions.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A taxpayer must meet certain requirements and pays off their tax debt. After that, the IRS may withdraw the Notice of Federal Tax Lien. Taxpayers must request this in writing, and we can help with this.</p>
<h5><strong>• Installment Agreements.</strong></h5>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Fresh Start program expanded access to streamlined installment agreements. Now, individual taxpayers who owe up to $50,000 can pay monthly direct debit payments for up to six years. They are also able to pay up to when the collection statutes expire &#8211; 10 years from the date the tax was assessed. While the IRS generally will not need a financial statement, they may need some financial information from the taxpayer. Your enrolled agent can collect and submit this for you.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Taxpayers in need of installment agreements for tax debts more than $50,000 or longer than six years still need to provide the IRS with a financial statement.</p>
<h5><strong>• Offers in Compromise.<img class=" wp-image-1843 alignright" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/What-to-do-when-the-IRS-sends-a-tax-notice-an-offer-in-compromise-dad-and-son-walking.jpg" alt="" width="260" height="254" /></strong></h5>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">An Offer in Compromise (OIC) allows taxpayers to settle their tax debt for less than the full amount. Fresh Start expanded and streamlined the OIC program. If approved, the IRS accepts a lesser amount – sometimes even just a fraction of what’s owed – to settle your debt. It isn’t always easy to gain approval (less than 40% was accepted in 2016). The IRS considers your income, assets, expenses, ability to pay, and potential hardship. However, the IRS now has more flexibility when analyzing a taxpayer’s ability to pay. This makes the offer program available to a larger group of taxpayers.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Generally, the IRS will accept an offer if it&#8217;s the most the agency can expect to collect within a reasonable period of time. The IRS will not accept an offer if the taxpayer can pay the amount owed in full.</p>
<h2><strong>Avoiding a Lien</strong></h2>
<p>You can avoid a federal tax lien by simply filing and paying all your taxes in full and on time. If you can’t file or pay on time, don’t ignore the letters or correspondence you get from the IRS. If the IRS sent a tax notice, Jeffrey Schneider, EA, CTRS is ready to help provide payment options that are available to help you settle your tax debt over time.</p>

<h2><strong>I have an overseas account, but I didn’t think about this!</strong></h2>
<p>If you have a foreign account, you have until April 15 to file a FINCEN 114 form electronically (formally FBAR) with the Treasury&#8217;s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network if you had interest in or signature authority over at least one account outside of the U.S., and the aggregate value of all the foreign accounts exceeded $10,000 at any time in the year (even for an hour).  However, in its infinite wisdom, the US Treasury allows for a 6 month extension – but no form has been created (unlike for other filings), so it’s an automatic extension.</p>
<p>Also, if you meet certain thresholds, a form has to be included with your income tax return.</p>
<p>Single filers who reside in the U.S. must submit Fact Form 8938 if the total value of their foreign financial assets exceeds $50,000 on the last day of the tax year ($100,000 for joint filers) or if the value exceeds $75,000 at any time during the year ($150,000 for couples filing jointly).</p>
<h2><strong>Keeping secrets? Not from the IRS, we hope. </strong></h2>
<p><img class=" wp-image-1769 alignright" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IRS-Forces-Full-Disclosure-for-Overseas-Accounts-tea-table-interesting.jpg" alt="" width="295" height="296" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IRS-Forces-Full-Disclosure-for-Overseas-Accounts-tea-table-interesting-150x150.jpg 150w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IRS-Forces-Full-Disclosure-for-Overseas-Accounts-tea-table-interesting-570x570.jpg 570w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IRS-Forces-Full-Disclosure-for-Overseas-Accounts-tea-table-interesting-500x500.jpg 500w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IRS-Forces-Full-Disclosure-for-Overseas-Accounts-tea-table-interesting-1000x1000.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 295px) 100vw, 295px" /></p>
<p>There are tons of people that have accounts overseas, for reasons both good and bad. Overseas bank accounts give account holders opportunities to invest internationally and guarantee international medical coverage! There are lots of perks with seeking international monetary safekeeping.</p>
<p>For example, you have parents who were born – and still live – overseas that you help to support. Their bank only has branches in that country. You wire money to that account from your bank here in the U.S.  You are technically on that account, even just as a signatory. On January 25<sup>th</sup>, you deposit $5,000 in that account that already has $5,500 USD in it. Then one day, your parents withdraw $10,400 USD to pay for something. That account never again has more than $10,000 in it. You still have a FINCEN 114 filing requirement.</p>
<p>If you are not declaring business receipts and keeping an account a secret, you’re taking illegal measures to keep tax-triggering facts and events secret. The IRS figured it out and is taking appropriate measures to collect their dues.</p>
<h2><strong>What if I Didn’t Report This?</strong></h2>
<p>You’ll be okay. For now. We can help you fill out a streamlined filing compliance and get you up-to-date if you weren’t aware of your filing obligations. There are 65,000 people who have jumped on this opportunity so far, but it won’t last forever.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-1770 alignleft" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IRS-Forces-Full-Disclosure-for-Overseas-Accounts-man-drinking-coffee-reading-newspaper.jpg" alt="" width="176" height="254" /></p>
<p>If you fail to disclose these amounts, you could face a penalty of up to $10,000. If you continue to withhold the information even after the IRS notifies you of a failure to disclose, you may face a maximum penalty of $60,000, along with potential criminal penalties.</p>
<p>You don’t want to face the consequences associated with missing the reporting requirement – you may lose $100,000 or even 50% of what you’ve put in that bank account (assuming it’s a lot, people don’t typically open these without serious reasoning.) Set up a consultation as soon as you can to meet with an enrolled agent – like Jeffrey Schneider, EA, CTRS.</p>
<p>On September 28<sup>th</sup>, the IRS is shutting down its voluntary disclosure program. Those who have failed to report their overseas accounts could be subject to large fines, penalties, and criminal prosecution. As it turns out, more than 56,000 taxpayers stepped up to the plate after the program began in 2009 to report their foreign financial assets; they had to pay <strong>$11.1 billion</strong> in back taxes, interest, and penalties.</p>
<p><em>Let’s take care of you!</em></p>
