<h2><strong>I have an overseas account, but I didn’t think about this!</strong></h2>
<p>If you have a foreign account, you have until April 15 to file a FINCEN 114 form electronically (formally FBAR) with the Treasury&#8217;s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network if you had interest in or signature authority over at least one account outside of the U.S., and the aggregate value of all the foreign accounts exceeded $10,000 at any time in the year (even for an hour).  However, in its infinite wisdom, the US Treasury allows for a 6 month extension – but no form has been created (unlike for other filings), so it’s an automatic extension.</p>
<p>Also, if you meet certain thresholds, a form has to be included with your income tax return.</p>
<p>Single filers who reside in the U.S. must submit Fact Form 8938 if the total value of their foreign financial assets exceeds $50,000 on the last day of the tax year ($100,000 for joint filers) or if the value exceeds $75,000 at any time during the year ($150,000 for couples filing jointly).</p>
<h2><strong>Keeping secrets? Not from the IRS, we hope. </strong></h2>
<p><img class=" wp-image-1769 alignright" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IRS-Forces-Full-Disclosure-for-Overseas-Accounts-tea-table-interesting.jpg" alt="" width="295" height="296" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IRS-Forces-Full-Disclosure-for-Overseas-Accounts-tea-table-interesting-150x150.jpg 150w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IRS-Forces-Full-Disclosure-for-Overseas-Accounts-tea-table-interesting-570x570.jpg 570w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IRS-Forces-Full-Disclosure-for-Overseas-Accounts-tea-table-interesting-500x500.jpg 500w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IRS-Forces-Full-Disclosure-for-Overseas-Accounts-tea-table-interesting-1000x1000.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 295px) 100vw, 295px" /></p>
<p>There are tons of people that have accounts overseas, for reasons both good and bad. Overseas bank accounts give account holders opportunities to invest internationally and guarantee international medical coverage! There are lots of perks with seeking international monetary safekeeping.</p>
<p>For example, you have parents who were born – and still live – overseas that you help to support. Their bank only has branches in that country. You wire money to that account from your bank here in the U.S.  You are technically on that account, even just as a signatory. On January 25<sup>th</sup>, you deposit $5,000 in that account that already has $5,500 USD in it. Then one day, your parents withdraw $10,400 USD to pay for something. That account never again has more than $10,000 in it. You still have a FINCEN 114 filing requirement.</p>
<p>If you are not declaring business receipts and keeping an account a secret, you’re taking illegal measures to keep tax-triggering facts and events secret. The IRS figured it out and is taking appropriate measures to collect their dues.</p>
<h2><strong>What if I Didn’t Report This?</strong></h2>
<p>You’ll be okay. For now. We can help you fill out a streamlined filing compliance and get you up-to-date if you weren’t aware of your filing obligations. There are 65,000 people who have jumped on this opportunity so far, but it won’t last forever.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-1770 alignleft" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IRS-Forces-Full-Disclosure-for-Overseas-Accounts-man-drinking-coffee-reading-newspaper.jpg" alt="" width="176" height="254" /></p>
<p>If you fail to disclose these amounts, you could face a penalty of up to $10,000. If you continue to withhold the information even after the IRS notifies you of a failure to disclose, you may face a maximum penalty of $60,000, along with potential criminal penalties.</p>
<p>You don’t want to face the consequences associated with missing the reporting requirement – you may lose $100,000 or even 50% of what you’ve put in that bank account (assuming it’s a lot, people don’t typically open these without serious reasoning.) Set up a consultation as soon as you can to meet with an enrolled agent – like Jeffrey Schneider, EA, CTRS.</p>
<p>On September 28<sup>th</sup>, the IRS is shutting down its voluntary disclosure program. Those who have failed to report their overseas accounts could be subject to large fines, penalties, and criminal prosecution. As it turns out, more than 56,000 taxpayers stepped up to the plate after the program began in 2009 to report their foreign financial assets; they had to pay <strong>$11.1 billion</strong> in back taxes, interest, and penalties.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was an otherwise uneventful Monday morning in Topeka, Kansas when local restaurant Annie’s Place was seized by the state for over $18,893.81 in unpaid sales taxes on July 23.</p>
<p>The owners were given until last Wednesday, July 25, to pay the taxes or reach some sort of agreement. Otherwise, the state could sell the business to satisfy all or a part of the tax debt.</p>
<p>There has been no online update on the story from <em>The Topeka Capital-Journal</em>, the <em>Aspen Times</em>, or the WIBW TV station – all of whom reported on the story originally. However, at about 1:15 pm on Thursday, July 26, Annie’s Place announced on Facebook it would open at 12:30 that day.</p>
<p>This is good news for the restaurant that has been operating since 1990 under its current ownership.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, news like this sends chills down the spines of business owners everywhere.</p>

<h3>Can it Happen to Me?</h3>
<p>The short answer is yes, it can happen to you. But not without plenty of warnings.</p>
<p>No taxing authority really wants to own a restaurant or any other type of business. They are in the business of collecting taxes already – and that keeps them quite busy. Seizing an asset is an extreme measure that is usually only taken when all other methods of collection fail.</p>
<p>The better question to ask?</p>
<h3>How do I Avoid this Happening to Me?</h3>
<p>Running a business is a very time-consuming endeavor.</p>
<p>You only have so much of this precious resource – 24 hours a day (of which a third is spent sleeping&#8230; if you are lucky enough to get the full 8).</p>
<p>Keeping track of taxes (and paying them on time) is best left to either an in-house bookkeeper –if you can afford one – or an accounting service.</p>
<p>After all, it’s not just about sales tax. There are payroll taxes and income taxes for the business to be concerned about. You must also keep track of your federal and your state income tax.</p>
<p>By getting the expert help you need, you free up your time to work on your business – which puts money in your pocket that can offset the cost – but you have peace of mind knowing that your taxes are being paid accurately and on time.<br />
