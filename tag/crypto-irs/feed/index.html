			<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">After years of flying under the radar, taxpayers who hold Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and other cryptocurrencies are finally getting scrutinized by the IRS its time to come clean about taxes on cryptocurrency. The IRS has determined that cryptocurrency is here to stay and that the outrageous refunds that early adopters have enjoyed could be a massive windfall for government coffers.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">The tax agency has also figured out that many earliest adopters to late comers who are holders of crypto could owe a lot of money on these assets. The currency may be virtual, but to the IRS, the taxes that are due are all too real.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">Note &#8211; if you think you might owe back taxes on your crypto, we encourage all readers to contact us at </span><a href="http://bit.ly/2Hh7cEl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><span style="color: #0e101a;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://bit.ly/2Hh7cE</span>l</span></em></a><span style="color: #0e101a;">.

<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">The Illusion of Anonymity</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">If you have been skating along under the veil of anonymity and failing to report your cryptocurrency holdings, you might want to rethink your strategy. After years of taking a mostly hands-off approach, the IRS is catching up in a big way. The agency is pulling out all the stops to recover the money the government believes is owed to them.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">Many holders of cryptocurrency are under the mistaken impression that their transactions are totally anonymous, and that there is no way for the IRS, or anyone else, to tell how much they hold or how they use their virtual coins. That may be a soothing fiction, but the reality is far different.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">The truth is that the IRS has a wide range of options at its disposal. From official form filings to subpoenas and legal documents, to pierce the veil of anonymity and find the real-world identities of cryptocurrency holders.</span></p>
<h5><strong><img class="alignright wp-image-4821" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IRS-form-1099-K-2020-300x158.png" alt="come clean about taxes on cryptocurrency- form 1099K" width="532" height="280" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IRS-form-1099-K-2020-300x158.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IRS-form-1099-K-2020-768x404.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IRS-form-1099-K-2020.png 1000w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IRS-form-1099-K-2020-700x368.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 532px) 100vw, 532px" />Did You Get a 1099-K? Well, So Did the IRS</strong></h5>
<p>In some cases, holders of cryptocurrency are finding tax forms in their mailboxes. If you receive this form, you can be sure the IRS received a copy as well.</p>
<p>When you file your taxes, an automatic matching program will compare the amount you claimed with the amount on these automatically generated forms. If there is a mismatch, you will hear from the IRS.</p>
<p>One of the most common forms used to report cryptocurrency holdings and transactions is the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/understanding-your-form-1099-k">1099-K</a>. For sellers on eBay and some freelancers, this form will already be familiar. Still, it is being extended into the virtual world as well. If you receive a 1099-K form this year, it is time to come clean with your cryptocurrency holdings.</p>
<h5><strong>The Cryptocurrency Question and Your Tax Form</strong></h5>
<p>Until now, cryptocurrency holders could and often did, plead ignorance. They could claim they did not realize their Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other virtual holdings were taxable. They could back up that assertion by saying the IRS never asked them about these assets. Time to come clean about taxes on cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>The validity of that excuse may have been questionable. Now that thin veil of supposed ignorance will be gone. Beginning with the 2019 tax return, taxpayers will be asked directly on their 1040 if they bought, sold, transacted, or otherwise acquired any cryptocurrency. They will be expected to answer that question truthfully.</p>
<p>The wording of this question means anyone who holds any cryptocurrency would be required to answer in the affirmative. Even so, merely holding virtual coins in a cryptocurrency wallet does not necessarily imply any taxes will be due. Someone who holds cryptocurrency but makes no transactions should not owe any taxes just as a holder of stock does not owe taxes until they sell the shares.</p>
<p>Come clean about taxes on cryptocurrency as the IRS is getting serious about cryptocurrency, drawn by a combination of past returns, unreported taxes, and increased exposure of these alternative forms of payment.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Early Adopters of Cryptocurrency Should Explore Their Tax Resolution Options. The stunning rise in the value of Bitcoin, along with the myriad of cryptocurrencies, is surely one of the biggest financial stories of the 21st century, at least so far. What started out as a mere curiosity and niche project for programmers and geeks has quickly blossomed into a full-fledged financial asset, and an increasingly popular one at that.</p>
<p>For early adopters, the financial returns have been simply mind-boggling. You may have heard about the generation of Bitcoin millionaires, and there are plenty of those newly rich investors to go around.</p>
<p>Given the rapid rise and relative anonymity of Bitcoin transactions, it was only a matter of time before the IRS caught on, and the tax agency has caught on &#8211; and caught up &#8211; in a big way. After years of taking a hands-off approach to cryptocurrency investments, the IRS is now paying close attention &#8211; and requesting the real-world identities of those supposedly anonymous buyers and sellers.</p>
<p>While every investor in cryptocurrency should be aware of their potential tax liability, the problem could be even more acute for early adopters &#8211; the very investors who have profited the most from this unique form of digital payment.</p>
<p>As with all things tax, the Internal Revenue Service is likely to start where the big money is, and the tax agency has increasingly set their sights on early adopters. If you were prescient enough to buy into the promise of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies when everyone else was looking the other way, it may be time to settle up with the IRS.</p>
<h4>Early Adopters of Cryptocurrencies</h4>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-3908" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2019-taxpayer-roadmap-300x296.jpg" alt="IRS road map maze" width="277" height="274" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2019-taxpayer-roadmap-300x296.jpg 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2019-taxpayer-roadmap.jpg 611w" sizes="(max-width: 277px) 100vw, 277px" /></p>
<p>For early adopters of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, a little proactivity could go a long way. The IRS has already requested records from Coinbase and other big cryptocurrency exchanges, and it is only a matter of time before they catch up to you and your profits.</p>
<p>For now, the tax agency claims it has requested information on only the largest accounts, but it is reasonable to assume the IRS will expand its scope in the future. If you have booked your Bitcoin profits and want to settle up with the IRS, contacting a tax resolution agency now could save you a lot of money &#8211; and potentially a lot of grief.</p>
<p>There are many reasons for early adopters of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to work with a tax resolution company, starting with the complexity of reporting profits in digital currency. The IRS is still fairly new to regulating and taxing cryptocurrency, and there has been a lot of confusion and misinformation over how profits are taxed and how people are supposed to pay.</p>
<p>Regardless, if you haven’t reported your crypto earnings or filed your taxes for the past few years, it’s time to do so now. By working with a tax resolution expert, you will gain access to a world of expertise, so you can draw on that knowledge to accurately report how much cryptocurrency you have purchased, how many coins you have used and how much you have gained or lost on each transaction.</p>
<p>This accounting is very important since it could impact not only your tax bill but any future taxes and penalties. According to the IRS, holders and users of cryptocurrencies have been responsible for reporting their gains all along and failing to do so could mean big penalties and lots of back interest.</p>
<h4>Tax Resolution Specialist</h4>
<p>A tax resolution specialist will be able to guide you through what is surely one of the most complicated tax situations in many years. The very complexity of the cryptocurrency market makes navigating the tax consequences especially difficult, and it never hurts to have some expert assistance in your corner. So, do yourself a favor and come clean now &#8211; <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-has-begun-sending-letters-to-virtual-currency-owners-advising-them-to-pay-back-taxes-file-amended-returns-part-of-agencys-larger-efforts">the IRS has finally caught on</a> to the cryptocurrency revolution, and the tax agency is making up for lost time and making the lives of early adopters a lot more difficult.</p>
