<p>If you’ve read our <a href="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/how-to-avoid-being-audited/">Top Ten</a> post about avoiding certain red flags, you’re probably aware that some issues are more likely to give rise to an audit than others. Former senior attorney with the Internal Revenue Service Chief Counsel, Laurie Kazenoff, has seen them all.</p>
<p>We took notes. Here are a few:</p>
<h2><strong><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-3515" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IRS-Common-Targets.png" alt="IRS Radar, Common Targets for Audit, chart, tax audits, millionaires, sfs, sfstax" width="680" height="443" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IRS-Common-Targets.png 680w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IRS-Common-Targets-300x195.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IRS-Common-Targets-400x260.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>You can’t completely avoid being audited</li>
<li>There are common targets on the IRS radar</li>
<li>Schedule Cs are a major target</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Schedule Cs: Under a Microscope</strong></h2>
<p>“The higher your income, the more likely you are to be audited, but the most commonly audited areas are Schedule Cs,” said Kazenoff. “[The reason for this is] because of the opportunity to fudge the numbers by understating income or inflating deductions such as home office or other expenses.”</p>
<p>“If the numbers are outside the norm, the computers will pick it up,” Kazenoff cautioned. “Most fields on a return are compared to averages, and outliers will be targeted. Large losses on both individual and business returns will be flagged. If you’re a going concern and have enormous losses, they want to know how you’re supporting yourself, or how you stay in business. If the numbers fall outside the national average, there’s a good chance of being picked up for an examination.”</p>
<h2><strong>Information Missing is a Huge Red Flag </strong></h2>
<p>“Many people don’t realize that the IRS matches every piece of third-party reporting with what taxpayers put on their return,” she said. “This includes interest income, dividend income, independent contractor income as well as W-2 income. The issuer is required to report it both to the taxpayer and the IRS. If the taxpayer fails to report the figures on their return — to the penny — the matching system will flag the return and they will receive a letter from the IRS.”</p>
<h2><strong>Not Every Industry is Considered an Equal Risk</strong></h2>
<h2><img class="alignright wp-image-3516" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/To-W2-or-not-to-W2.jpg" alt="IRS Radar, Common Targets for Audit, employee, independent contractor, 1099, sfs, sfstax" width="450" height="449" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/To-W2-or-not-to-W2.jpg 1200w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/To-W2-or-not-to-W2-150x150.jpg 150w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/To-W2-or-not-to-W2-300x300.jpg 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/To-W2-or-not-to-W2-768x768.jpg 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/To-W2-or-not-to-W2-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/To-W2-or-not-to-W2-570x570.jpg 570w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/To-W2-or-not-to-W2-500x500.jpg 500w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/To-W2-or-not-to-W2-1000x1000.jpg 1000w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/To-W2-or-not-to-W2-700x700.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></h2>
<p>“The service issues a list of industries they target, such as the mining industry,&#8221; she said. “And there are businesses that have historically underreported income. Businesses where cash changes hands, such as restaurants and laundromats, are examples. But although gas stations deal in cash, they have an independent record-keeping system.”</p>
<h2><strong>Are Independent Contractors Frequently Audited? </strong></h2>
<p>The IRS also targets independent contractor situations. Kazenoff noted, “Are the workers really employees?”</p>
<p>Worker misclassification is an important issue for the IRS and various state taxing authorities because of the perception that many employers are not properly classifying their workers. By avoiding labeling their workers as employees, employers can avoid paying payroll taxes, minimum wages, overtime, health and retirement benefits, and paid leave.</p>
<p>“A lot of companies try to avoid payroll taxes, workers compensation and unemployment withholding,” she said. “They think they can get off the hook, but it’s an issue the IRS will pursue.” Although there is no bright-line test to judge whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor, “[The IRS] will look to see if certain factors are present to determine if the worker is really an independent contractor,” she said.</p>
<h2><strong>General Guidelines </strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Employee:</strong> Under common-law rules, anyone who performs services for you is your employee if you can control what will be done and how it will be done. This is so even when you give the employee freedom of action. What matters is that you have the right to control how the services are performed.</li>
<li><strong>Independent Contractor:</strong> The general rule is that an individual is an independent contractor if the payer has the right to control or direct only the result of the work and not what will be done and how it will be done.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Filing a Large Claim for a Refund on an Amended Return</strong></h2>
<p>Filing a large claim for a refund on an amended return will almost always cause an audit, according to Kazenoff. “They will wonder what you did wrong on the first return,” she said. “It will almost always be picked up.”</p>
<p>“If the original return failed to include an item of income, of course, you will want to correct it on an amended return,” she said. “But filing an amended return that claims credits that you didn’t claim on the first return will open up the whole return to scrutiny, so you end up being audited on other things not originally at issue.”</p>
<p>This is particularly true where the amended return raises new issues, she indicated. “As an example, a return might be amended to claim R&amp;D credits that weren’t on the original return. The IRS is likely to audit for that particular issue, but will open up the entire return for questioning,” she said.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Forget 10,000 Leagues Under the Sea. You’ll have to dive much deeper than that to get to the heart of the IRS.</strong></h2>
<p>When it comes to the administration and enforcement of our tax system, there are four basic levels:</p>
<h2><strong><img class="wp-image-3636 size-full alignright" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Chapter-Meme-B-1.jpg" alt="" width="526" height="526" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Chapter-Meme-B-1.jpg 526w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Chapter-Meme-B-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Chapter-Meme-B-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Chapter-Meme-B-1-500x500.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px" /></strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Examinations (Audits)</li>
<li>Collections</li>
<li>Appeals</li>
<li>Criminal Investigations</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s time to talk about the first three.</p>
<h2><strong>Examinations (Audits) </strong></h2>
<p>When a return is filed and processed, it is automatically deemed correct unless the IRS computers find an error.</p>
<h3><strong>What types of errors are picked up by the computers?</strong></h3>
<p>If you understate the income reported, overreport expenses, or report you had health insurance when you did not, the computer spits out a notice showing what they have compared to what you’ve put on your return.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you’ll get selected for audit (done locally or by mail). The auditor can pick up on these same errors or omissions.</p>
<h2><strong>Collections</strong></h2>
<p>The Internal Revenue Service is the world’s largest and most aggressive collection agency. Even with their funding woes, they can and will come after you (either in person or by mail <a href="https://sfstaxacct.com/2019/04/2019-dirty-dozen-list-of-tax-scams/">– never a phone call or email.</a>)</p>
<h2><strong><img class="alignright wp-image-3638 " src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/You-Have-It-We-Want-It-sfs-now-what-help-courtroom-courthouse-outside-2.jpg" alt="" width="427" height="645" /></strong></h2>
<p>One of the IRS collection units is the Automated Collections Service, or ACS. They have various service centers around the country. Then, there are Settlement Officers. These officials are usually in the IRS Appeals Office.</p>
<h2><strong>Appeals </strong></h2>
<p>A taxpayer usually gets one shot at appeals. The next step is to prepare and file a tax court petition. Generally, you can file this once you receive a 90-day notice (Statutory Notice of Deficiency.) You can prepare the petition:</p>
<ul>
<li>yourself</li>
<li>by a U.S. Tax Court Practitioner</li>
<li>by an attorney licensed to practice in your state</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, there is a $60 fee. You will wait until your petition gets on the court docket. Then, it is assigned to an IRS lawyer. Most of the time, IRS attorneys will “send it back to appeals,” because most cases are not USTC worthy (i.e. not enough money).</p>
<p>If you do not want to go to court (it is not cheap unless you do it yourself, and that is not highly recommended) and you cannot/do not pay, that is the crux of this book.</p>
<p>Just as you have the right to appeal an IRS decision, you also have the right to be represented.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Will My Income Tax Return be Audited?</strong></h1>
<p>For the vast majority of taxpayers, there is not much need to worry that you will be audited. In 2016, only 0.6% of individual income tax returns were audited according to the IRS <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/17databk.pdf">2017 Data Book</a>. Why? For starters, after the IRS budget cuts, we lost 2,200 agents that previously audited returns.</p>
<p>The “real” audit rate, however, is closer to 7.0%. The IRS does not include the over 9.2 million notices that are questioning items on your client’s tax returns (such as forgetting to include a 1099-Misc form).  The IRS is relying more and more on technology to uncover underreporting and underpayment of taxes.</p>
<p>The following are the different taxpayer groups are more susceptible to catching the attention of auditors.</p>
<p><img class="alignright  wp-image-2350" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Will-My-Income-Tax-Return-be-Audited-atlas-map-international-countries.jpg" alt="Will My Income Tax Return be Audited?" width="276" height="181" /></p>
<h3>Returns that report more than $10 Million in income or report no income</h3>
<p>Sixteen percent of individuals who reported over $10 million in income were audited in 2014. Surprisingly, the IRS audited those returns at a higher rate than those that reported no income.</p>
<p>The IRS audited 5.3% of tax returns with no income in 2014. If your income is $25,000 &#8211; $200,000, it is unlikely that you will be singled out for an audit.</p>
<h3><strong>Estate Tax Returns of More than $5 Million</strong></h3>
<p>In 2014, the IRS did an audit on 8.5% of estate tax returns which was well above the .9% of individual returns. 21% of even larger estate tax returns (between $5 million to $10 million) were audited, while 27% of those over $10 million received an audit.</p>
<h3><strong>Individual Filing of International Returns Raises a Red Flag</strong></h3>
<p>The IRS is focusing more attention on international returns. Statements made by experts in the field, strongly emphasized the practice of <a href="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/irs-forces-full-disclosure-for-overseas-accounts/">offshore tax evasion</a> as being fundamentally unfair. Wealthy people evading the law by stashing their money overseas and not paying their share of tax is forcing the bulk of lower income citizens to foot the bill to fund the government. In 2014, they audited 4.8% of international returns.</p>
<h3><strong>Errors in Information Entered</strong></h3>
<p>If someone filling out income tax forms makes simple, careless mistakes, red flags go up to the tax auditors. Filers neglect to get all report forms and statements together and forget to report dependents and exemptions correctly. The automated systems recognize these discrepancies, but can&#8217;t tell if they are actual mistakes or intentional. <a href="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/how-to-avoid-being-audited/">Neglecting to report all your income</a> and other figures could result in an audit especially at higher incomes. Those who contribute to more charities and other organizations open up the possibility for fraud.</p>
<h3><strong>Reports of Unrealistic Itemized Deductions<img class="alignright  wp-image-2351" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Will-My-Income-Tax-Return-be-Audited-finance-sheet-apple-coffee-camera-cactus.jpg" alt="Will My Income Tax Return be Audited, finance, sheet, apple, coffee, camera, cactus" width="355" height="234" /></strong></h3>
<p>An individual or small business could be signaled out for an audited if they claim itemized deductions that are clearly out of line. Filers need to know what a legitimate deduction entails.</p>
<p>Carefully reading directions for completing forms and checking for accuracy and honesty will reduce the chances of an audit. Hiring a tax professional, specifically someone with tax resolution experience like our firm, can help you stay out of tax trouble.</p>

Attempting to cut your tax liability by getting into IRS grey areas can cause you problems later on. You don&#8217;t have to do anything unethical to get your return pulled for an audit; you may just have raised too many red flags. Also, an audit can be done via letter, (i.e. <a href="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/now-what-i-got-a-cp2000-notice-help/">CP2000 Notice</a>) not just face-to-face. If you’re in the middle of an audit, or owe back taxes, contact Jeffrey Schneider, EA, CTRS to resolve your tax problem(s). Here are the top 10 red flags the IRS target that you want to avoid:</p>
<h3><strong>1. Making too much money</strong></h3>
<p>First, here&#8217;s a problem most of us would dream to have. Making over $200,000! You&#8217;re honestly more likely to be audited. The fact is that there are fewer auditors, so the IRS is focusing on where they can make the most bang for their buck.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Not reporting all of your income </strong></h3>
<p>No matter how much or little you make, you have to report everything. In some way or other, unless you run a strictly cash business, all of your income is reported to the IRS. W2, 1099 and other forms you receive are duplicated, then they are sent in to the IRS. If your reported income doesn&#8217;t match theirs, you will get a notice.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Math errors </strong></h3>
<p>Your information will be entered into a computer whether you file electronically or file a paper form. Remember, the one thing computers are very good at is doing math and if things don’t add up, or there was an honest mistake while inputting the information, it can raise a red flag. A math error won&#8217;t necessarily generate an audit, but it will get the attention you may not want. Make sure to double check your returns. Better yet, have a qualified tax professional assist you and keep you out of tax trouble.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Home businesses that never make money<img class="alignright wp-image-1933" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/How-to-Avoid-Being-Audited-cartoon-woman-shocked-thinking-i-thought-i-could-just-write-it-off.jpg" alt="How to Avoid Being Audited, cartoon woman, shocked, thinking, i thought i could just write it off" width="262" height="388" /></strong></h3>
<p>Sole proprietorships that file a Schedule C year after year and always show a loss will raise a red flag. You could even show a profit, but if the profit margin is always unreasonably small, then that will get the IRS&#8217; attention.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Large charitable deductions</strong></h3>
<p>There is nothing wrong with being charitable and there is no legal limit to how much of your hard earned cash you can give away. It is another red flag, however, if your donation is different than what’s considered the norm.</p>
<h3><strong>6. Overstating business expenses</strong></h3>
<p>Depending on the type of job you have, there can be many legitimate expenses that your employer doesn&#8217;t reimburse you for. Don&#8217;t be tempted to write off just a little extra if you have your own business. These might be genuine deductions you&#8217;re considering. However, you don&#8217;t want to deduct something that&#8217;s not on the approved list and don&#8217;t claim deductions way outside the norm. Check with your tax professional – or if you don’t have one, consider Jeffrey Schneider, EA, CTRS, NPTI Fellow &#8211; who is up to date with tax laws. You don’t want to be padding your tax return with write-offs.</p>
<h3><strong>7. Sketchy real estate rental revenue or losses</strong></h3>
<p>Some people will &#8216;rent&#8217; their property to friends or family at well below market value and then claim normal rental business expenses. As with other areas, the IRS compares what you claim against local standards to determine if this is a legit business. If not, they will disallow the deductions.</p>
<h3><strong>8. Home office deductions</strong></h3>
<p>There are absolutely legitimate home office deductions but the IRS has very strict guidelines on what you can claim and how much. Try to claim too much and this is a classic red flag.</p>
<h3><strong>9. Claiming losses for things that aren&#8217;t deductible or deductible in your circumstances </strong></h3>
<p>For example, claiming day-trading losses on a Schedule C. If you dabble in stock trading and take a loss, it may or may not be deductible, but almost certainly doesn&#8217;t qualify for a Schedule C loss. You also can&#8217;t take a deduction for alimony as a business expense. The IRS maintains a list of non-deductible expenses, make sure to check that and check with your tax professional.</p>
<h3><strong><img class="alignright wp-image-1934" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/How-to-Avoid-Being-Audited-red-bentley-mountains-cloudy-skies-interior-car.jpg" alt="How to Avoid Being Audited, red, bentley, mountains, cloudy, skies, interior, car" width="324" height="226" /></strong></h3>
<h3><strong>10. Claiming 100% business use of your vehicle</strong></h3>
<p>If you spend most of the time in your vehicle doing your job, you may think it&#8217;s easier just to claim the whole amount as a business expense, but this is wrong. You will either have to show your personal use, no matter how small, or have to show you have a second vehicle for personal use.</p>
<h2><strong>How it Gets Confusing</strong></h2>
<p>Many of these items are red flags for an audit, but many are also legitimate deductions. The key is to have a qualified tax professional on your side. When it comes to tax resolution, Jeffrey Schneider, EA, CTRS knows how to navigate the IRS maze. He can help you minimize the risk of an audit and the resulting tax problems down the road. Also, he will ensure you have meticulous records and keep you within the guidelines of the IRS.</p>
<p>If you need an expert tax resolution professional, reach out to us and we’ll schedule a no-obligation confidential consultation. Jeffrey Schneider, EA, CTRS will explain your options and help permanently resolve your tax problem.</p>
