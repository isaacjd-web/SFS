								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>How to Recognize an IRS Tax Scam and What to Do if the Tax Due Notice is Real</h4>
<p>Is My Tax Notice Real? Hearing from the IRS is bad enough but being contacted by a scammer posing as the IRS is even worse. Or at least just annoying and frightening. IRS scams are everywhere these days, and they take many different forms. Even sophisticated taxpayers have been fooled by these crooks, sometimes losing thousands of dollars in the process.</p>
<p>In other words, if you do not want to be the next victim, you need to educate yourself about how these scams originate, what forms they take, and how the perpetrators prey on an inherent fear of the IRS.</p>
<h4>Here are some warning signs to look out for when someone claiming to be from the IRS comes calling.</h4>
<ol>
<li> The tax bill comes out of the blue. Notices of taxes due are rarely surprises. If you have always paid your taxes on time, a past due notice or other scare tactics should be met with skepticism.</li>
<li> The &#8220;agent&#8221; threatens to have you arrested. IRS agents are scary, but they will not threaten you with arrest or imprisonment before the audit process has even begun.</li>
<li> You are offered relief in exchange for immediate payment. The process of paying overdue taxes and resolving tax disputes is long and complicated. Offers of an immediate settlement are common signs of a scam.</li>
<li> The caller asks you to pay your bill with gift cards. The IRS does not accept iTunes gift cards or prepaid phone cards as payment for taxes due. If the &#8220;agent&#8221; on the other end of the line asks for these payments, just hang up.</li>
<li>You receive a phone call or a message on your cell phone. The IRS does not use phone calls as a primary means of communication. If you are not in current negotiations with the IRS, the tax agency will never call you.</li>
<li>The communication comes via email. If you owe money to the IRS or the agency has questions about your return, they will contact you via U.S. mail. Notices of tax due that come in the form of email are always scams &#8211; and the emails themselves often harbor dangerous viruses and other malware.</li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, if you wish to better understand the tax notice you receive, check out my first book, Now What? I Got a Tax Notice From the IRS. Help! available on <a href="http://amzn.to/2phfdQE">Amazon</a>.</p>
<h4>Is My Tax Notice Real?</h4>
<p>Now that you know how to spot an IRS collection scam, what happens if the communication is real? What should you do if you do receive a snail mail notice saying you owe additional taxes? Here are some critical steps to take if that dreaded letter shows up in your mailbox.</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft wp-image-3972" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/hands-forms-reaching--300x300.png" alt="Is my tax notice real hands reaching for help" width="295" height="295" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/hands-forms-reaching--300x300.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/hands-forms-reaching--150x150.png 150w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/hands-forms-reaching-.png 381w" sizes="(max-width: 295px) 100vw, 295px" />Contact A Tax Resolution Professional</strong></p>
<p>If you owe back taxes to the IRS, there are some definite benefits to hiring a tax resolution service. These companies exist for a reason, and they can provide a way out for taxpayers who feel overwhelmed by the whole process.</p>
<p>Negotiating with the IRS on your own can be intimidating, and the tax agency may not offer you the best terms. Experienced tax resolution firms are used to dealing with the IRS, and more often than not, they can get you a better deal.</p>
<p><strong>Verify Their Contact Information or Contact the IRS Directly </strong></p>
<p>While it is uncommon, some scammer is using the U.S. mail to perpetrate their schemes. Before you write a check, contact the IRS and make sure the communication is legitimate.</p>
<p>It would help if you looked up the IRS phone number at their website irs.gov, instead of simply calling the phone number in the letter you received. If the letter is a scam, the phone number provided will send you to the perpetrators of the fraud. If you want to know the truth, contact the IRS directly.</p>
<p><strong>Think About How Much You Can Afford to Pay</strong></p>
<p>Paying a huge tax bill is sure to be a burden, even for middle and upper-class taxpayers. If you know you cannot afford to pay the entire amount due, think about how much you can pay. You have options &#8211; either in monthly installments or all at once.</p>
<p>The tax agency is often willing to work with taxpayers to pay off the amount they owe; payment plans are common. However, if you plan to go this route, it pays to seek professional help. An experienced tax resolution expert can help you work out a compromise or payment plan you can afford.</p>
<p><strong>Take Interest and Penalties into Account<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3908" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2019-taxpayer-roadmap-300x296.jpg" alt="IRS road map maze" width="300" height="296" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2019-taxpayer-roadmap-300x296.jpg 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2019-taxpayer-roadmap.jpg 611w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></strong></p>
<p>If you receive a notice of additional taxes due, time is of the essence. In other words, once that notice goes out, the clock starts ticking, and your interest and penalties can add up fast.</p>
<p>Above all, the sooner you act, the sooner you can start to settle your obligation, so you can set your mind at ease and get on with the rest of your life. No one likes to owe money to the IRS, and simply being contacted can be enough to set your heart pounding. If you do find yourself in such a situation, it pays to act fast and seek the help of an experienced tax settlement professional.</p>
<h4>What to Do if the Tax Due Notice is Real</h4>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Monday, August 6 the news hit the WKBN website. In Broadman, Ohio, police were warning of a tax scam besieging the area.</p>
<p>Twenty-five calls on one Monday morning will definitely raise the red flag. That’s how many complaints flooded Boardman police about the scam.</p>
<p>The tax scam involved phone calls received from a 434 area code. It’s well known that technology exists to “spoof” any telephone number (even your own, which really causes a moment’s pause!). So although Virginia is home to the area code, the calls can be coming from anywhere.</p>
<p>In fact, the Chief of Police, Todd Werth, told the TV station that the calls are likely coming from overseas.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-1445 alignright" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Tax-Scam-Alert-434-Area-Code-Scam-Calls-Make-the-News-in-Ohio-SFS-Tax-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-smart-phone-tax-scam-call-IRS-scammers-192x300.png" alt="Tax Scam Alert, 434 Area Code Scam Calls Make the News in Ohio, SFS Tax, SFS Tax Problem Solutions, smart phone, tax scam call, IRS scammers" width="192" height="300" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Tax-Scam-Alert-434-Area-Code-Scam-Calls-Make-the-News-in-Ohio-SFS-Tax-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-smart-phone-tax-scam-call-IRS-scammers-192x300.png 192w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Tax-Scam-Alert-434-Area-Code-Scam-Calls-Make-the-News-in-Ohio-SFS-Tax-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-smart-phone-tax-scam-call-IRS-scammers.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 192px) 100vw, 192px" /></p>
<h3><strong>What is the Tax Scam? </strong></h3>
<p>The folks who received the calls from the tax scammers were told they owed money to the IRS. They were instructed to send the money right away… using a wire transfer or a gift card.</p>
<p>And if they didn’t pay? The scammers told victims they’d be arrested, their driver’s license would be suspended, or their businesses shut down.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the tax scammers threatened to be at the victim’s front door within 24 if payment was not received. There were reports that these scammers became “hostile and insulting” as the calls went on.</p>
<p>Other victims were actually informed that they had a refund coming. Why would tax scammers do that? To get you to share personal information. It’s good to note here that the IRS already has your information and knows where to send a refund if one is due. They don’t need your address or your bank account… and wouldn’t ask for it over the phone.</p>
<p>In some cases, the calls weren’t answered and so the tax scammers left “urgent callback requests.”</p>

<h3><strong>How Do You Know if It is a Tax Scam? </strong></h3>
<p>Having some knowledge of how the IRS operates can help you protect yourself (and others, should you get calls from elderly relatives).</p>
<p>You should keep the following in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First, the IRS usually initiates contact by mail.</strong> They will not call or show up at your door as their initial warning that you owe tax.</li>
<li><strong>Second, they will never demand that you pay the immediately over the phone. </strong>Instead, you will receive several notices in the mail, the first of which will let you know to contact them if you do not agree that you owe the balance. These notices also give instructions on how to set up a payment plan in the event that you can’t pay the tax you owe at once.</li>
<li><strong>Third, the IRS will not ask you to verify your identity using personal information </strong>or ask for your credit card or debit card numbers (and especially not over the phone).</li>
<li><strong>Fourth, the IRS does not specify that you must pay them in a specific method.</strong> The tax scammers asked for a wire transfer or payment by gift card. That should make the hairs on the back of the necks of any would-be victim stand up.</li>
<li><strong>Finally, the IRS will not threaten to have you arrested or take other such extreme action if you can’t pay them immediately.</strong> Again, you will be informed by mail of what you owe and have the opportunity to appeal their findings.</li>
</ul>
<p>When in doubt, hang up. A quick call to your Enrolled Agent can reassure you that you don’t owe any tax. Or, if you do, it is being dealt with properly… and you aren’t going to have a SWAT team descend upon your doorstep.</p>
