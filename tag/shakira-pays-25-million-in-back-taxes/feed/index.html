<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Shakira Pays $25 Million in Back Taxes</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://people.com/tag/shakira/">Shakira</a> has reportedly paid a major bill for back taxes owed to the Spanish government.</p>
<p>According to numerous reports, this international superstar has paid more than 20 million Euros &#8211; or $25 million &#8211; to the Spanish authorities to settle part of a tax fraud debt pending ongoing investigation.</p>
<p>The investigation seeks to establish whether Shakira legally resided in Spain with her longtime boyfriend, Barcelona Futbol Club soccer player Gerard Piqué, between the years 2011 and 2014.<img class="alignright  wp-image-2302" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Shakira-Pays-25-Million-in-Back-Taxes.jpg" alt="Shakira Pays $25 Million in Back Taxes, Barcelona, architecture, building, ancient" width="303" height="265" /></p>
<p>Spanish law states that if an individual spends more than 183 days in the country, they are considered a legal resident and liable for paying taxes on income acquired internationally. However, those spending fewer than 183 days in Spain would only be accountable for income earned within the country.</p>
<h3>The Defense Has Spoken</h3>
<p>Shakira, 41, reportedly claimed that she had spent the majority of those years as a resident of the Bahamas. She claims to have filed her taxes accordingly. In documents obtained by both <em>El Periodico</em> and <em>El Pais,</em> the singer’s defense claimed that she had indeed spent most of her time abroad, and made no effort to intentionally hide her income, citing any misunderstandings as “a difference in criteria.”</p>
<p>It was confirmed that in 2009, Shakira relocated her intellectual property rights and brands to a company based in Malta. Malta is known for and has faced allegations of being a tax heaven.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-2301" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Shakira-Pays-25-Million-in-Back-Taxes-shakira-court-courtroom-stressed.jpg" alt="Shakira Pays $25 Million in Back Taxes, shakira, court, courtroom, stressed" width="270" height="176" />Spanish press reports have detailed extensive efforts of local tax authorities to establish Shakira’s place of residence during the years in question. They’ve begun studying photos of the star out and about in Spain to piece together her story. They even interviewed her hairstylist.</p>
<p>Shakira’s reported payment covers the amount owed for 2011, while the investigation into taxes owed for 2012-2014 remains ongoing, <em>El Periodico </em>claims. Once completed, the district attorney and the Agencia Estatal de Administración Tributaria (Spanish Tax Agency; their equivalence of our Internal Revenue Service) are expected to decide if tax fraud charges will be brought. Then, the case will proceed to court.</p>
<h3><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h3>
<p>If she did commit tax fraud, Shakira would join a <a href="https://www.thetaxdefensegroup.com/five-famous-people-who-committed-tax-fraud/">list</a> of celebrities who have been in trouble with tax authorities.</p>
