			<p style="text-align: left;">C is for the <em>Currently Not Collectible</em><em> </em><em>Status </em>from the IRS</p>
<p>Big companies are known for getting all sorts of breaks, but when average people fall behind, they rarely receive help. When you owe back taxes, but can’t afford to pay them, then you may qualify for a special tax status known as <em>currently not collectible</em>.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-4118 alignleft" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/C-is-for-currently-not-collectible-300x158.png" alt="" width="391" height="206" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/C-is-for-currently-not-collectible-300x158.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/C-is-for-currently-not-collectible-768x404.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/C-is-for-currently-not-collectible.png 1000w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/C-is-for-currently-not-collectible-700x368.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 391px) 100vw, 391px" /></p>
<p>If you’re IRS approved for currently not collectible status, they must not only cease its collection efforts, but they can no longer garnish your wages or seize your property.</p>

<p><strong>What is Currently Not Collectible Status? </strong></p>
<p>If the IRS agrees that you can’t pay your back taxes and cover your reasonable living expenses, they may place your account in the Currently Not Collectible status.  This determination is based on your <img class="alignright wp-image-4111" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-300x300.png" alt="warning sign, do not try this alone" width="269" height="269" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-300x300.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-150x150.png 150w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-768x768.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-570x570.png 570w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-500x500.png 500w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-1000x1000.png 1000w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-700x700.png 700w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 269px) 100vw, 269px" />current financial situation.</p>
<p>You can request currently not collectible status by submitting the proper form and proof to the IRS of your income and expenses, as well as whether you can sell any assets you may have or get a loan.</p>
<p>As you’ll need to be able to document your inability to pay, be sure to gather copies of all your bills, your most recent paycheck stubs, and statements detailing other sources of income such as alimony, pensions or investments. If the IRS determines that your necessary expenses exceed your income, then it will notify you of your Currently Not Collectable status.</p>
<p>WARNING: Don’t try to do this alone. We recommend reaching out to our tax resolution firm to guide you through your options. Talking to the IRS directly could be like shooting yourself in the foot. They’ll ask you very invasive questions that could land you in deeper trouble. Remember, the IRS is not your friend. Their job is to collect what they believe you owe them, so it’s best to have a professional in your corner.</p>
<p><strong>Not a Permanent Solution</strong></p>
<p>Keep in mind that currently not collectible status applies only to your back taxes. You will still have to file tax returns, and you will not be exempted from paying current and future taxes. You will also continue to accumulate penalties and interest on your unpaid taxes. After a year or two, the IRS may review your status, and if you’re able to begin paying your back taxes, then you must do so. If you’re still not able to pay, then your status will be renewed.</p>
<p><strong>Statute of Limitations   </strong></p>
<p>The IRS can attempt to collect outstanding taxes for only ten years from the date the taxes were assessed against you; usually, that’s the date you filed. If at the end of this 10-year period the IRS hasn’t collected, then the taxes are no longer owed.</p>
<p>In difficult times, many families have trouble meeting their commitments. If you’re worried about the IRS garnishing your wages, levying your bank account, or taking your home, then reaching out to our firm and getting a free, no-obligation, confidential consultation on your tax problem may give you some peace of mind. If you’re not approved for Currently Not Collectible status, our firm will explain the many other tax relief options with you.

			<p><strong>Owe Money to the IRS? It&#8217;s Called Back Taxes</strong></p>
<p>Back taxes refer to taxes owed from a prior year.</p>
<p>A taxpayer may be behind in paying taxes for intentional or negligent reasons. Some of these reasons include – filing a return and failing to pay the tax liability; failing to report all income earned during the tax year, and; neglecting to file a tax return for a given tax year.</p>

<p>If taxes remain unpaid after multiple notices have been sent by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), a minimum penalty fee of $135 will be charged in addition to interest on the unpaid amount, which is 0.5% per month that the taxpayer is late, up to 25%. As the total tax debt increases each month due to penalty and interest, over time, it can grow into a significant amount.</p>

We can file all of your deinquent returns and help you with the penalties and interest.  Contact our firm here for an evaluation of your situation. <em>Visit our website, <a href="http://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/">sfstaxproblemsolutions.com</a> to book your <strong>Free Debt Settlement Analysis</strong> at </em><a href="https://go.oncehub.com/jeffreyschneider"><strong>https://go.oncehub.com/jeffreyschneider.</strong></a></p>
<p>Unpaid back taxes can be a serious issue for many taxpayers who don&#8217;t have the means to pay them. Depending upon the circumstances, the government may take one of many strategies to deal with back taxes, such as pressing charges, demanding that that the taxpayer pay immediately, or sometimes offering a voluntary disclosure program which helps avoid criminal charges and allows a variety of payment options. Failure to pay taxes can also involve imprisonment.</p>
<p>In some cases, the IRS will seize property, seize assets, or place liens on property. The IRS may place a federal tax lien to inform other creditors of the taxing authorities legal right to a taxpayer’s assets and property. The IRS also has the power to garnish a taxpayer’s wages and to levy their financial accounts, seizing up to the total amount of taxes owed. If the taxes remain unpaid, the tax authority can use a tax levy to legally seize the taxpayer&#8217;s assets (such as bank accounts, investment accounts, automobiles, and real property) in order to collect the money, it is owed. While a lien secures the government’s interest or claim in an individual’s or business’ property when the tax debt remains unpaid, a levy actually permits the government to seize and sell the property in order to pay the tax debt.</p>

			<p>IRS Appeals</p>
<p>An unexpected envelope from the Internal Revenue Service is never a good thing.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s never pleasant, but any letter that you receive should not be ignored, especially if you disagree with an IRS decision.</p>
<p>In fact, the IRS Taxpayer Bill of Rights covers this specific situation as one of a taxpayer&#8217;s rights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay no more than the correct amount of tax,</li>
<li>Challenge the IRS&#8217; position and be heard and</li>
<li>Appeal an IRS decision in an independent forum</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some tips on getting through an IRS disagreement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get professional help: First, if you don&#8217;t have a tax professional, get one.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if your disputed tax situation is not that complicated, dealing with the IRS can be difficult. A tax professional that has standing with the IRS, like an Enrolled Agent (EA), CPA, or attorney with experience in resolving issues between the IRS and taxpayers can save you time, and money. A Certified Tax Resolution Specialist (CTRS) is specially trained to argue your case before the IRS.</p>
<ul>
<li>Know the general appeals process: Your tax pro will help you understand what to expect and what happens during your appeal process.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Appeals Office is separate from and independent of the IRS office that took action against you. It&#8217;s also the only level of administrative appeal within the IRS.</p>
<p>Conferences with an Appeals Office representative can be held informally by correspondence, telephone, or at a face-to-face meeting.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to have official representation at an appeals conference, but as noted at the beginning of this post, it&#8217;s generally a good idea.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4156" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IRS-letter-300x251.png" alt="IRS letter-sfs tax problem solutions" width="300" height="251" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IRS-letter-300x251.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IRS-letter-768x644.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IRS-letter-700x587.png 700w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IRS-letter.png 940w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Preparation is essential: If you do go to the Appeals Office, be prepared to discuss all issues you don&#8217;t agree with at the conference.</p>
<p>You also might need to file a formal written protest or a small case request with the office named in the IRS letter you received.</p>
<p>And definitely be sure to file your protest within the time limit specified in the letter you received.</p>
<p>Specifically, Appeals isn&#8217;t interested in and won&#8217;t accept any objection you have based on moral, religious, political, constitutional, conscientious, or similar grounds.</p>
<ul>
<li>Let the pros handle it: Your tax adviser can file the written protest for you.</li>
</ul>
<p>He or she also can take care of the discussions or hearings without you if you decide you just don&#8217;t want to go it alone.</p>
<p>If you do opt to skip the Appeal Office meeting and send only your lawyer, CPA or EA to make your case, be sure you have completed a power of attorney form allowing your representative to receive and inspect confidential information.</p>
<ul>
<li>Beyond Appeals: The IRS says that going through the Office of Appeals process generally settles most tax disputes without expensive and time-consuming court trials.</li>
</ul>
<p>If, however, that&#8217;s not the case in your tax disagreement, you can take your protest to the judicial level. This includes appeals to the United States Tax Court, the United States Court of Federal Claims or your United States District Court.</p>
<p>In difficult times, many families have trouble meeting their commitments. If you’re worried about the IRS garnishing your wages, levying your bank account, or taking your home,</p>
