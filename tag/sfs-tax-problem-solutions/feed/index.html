								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This article about Cryptocurrency Tax Loss Harvesting explains:</p>
<ul>
<li>what is tax loss harvesting</li>
<li>how you can use this method to reduce your cryptocurrency tax liability</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the most effective ways to reduce your tax bill for the year is to engage in tax loss harvesting with your cryptocurrency assets. It’s common knowledge that cryptocurrencies are incredibly volatile. Realizing your tax loss and other characteristics make it a useful candidate for tax loss harvesting strategies.</p>
<h4>What is Tax Loss Harvesting?</h4>
<p>Tax Loss Harvesting is the practice of selling a capital asset at a loss to offset a capital gains tax liability. By realizing or “harvesting” a loss, investors can offset taxes on both gains and income. This is a tax reduction strategy often used in the world of stocks and securities.</p>
<h5>Let’s look at a general example:</h5>
<p>Beth buys $1,000 of Microsoft stock and $2,000 of Apple stock in a given year. While holding these investments, the value of her Microsoft stock rises to $1,500, while Apple drops to $1,700. She sells all of his Microsoft stock for $1,500.</p>
<h5>Without Tax Loss Harvesting</h5>
<p>Without harvesting her losses in Microsoft stock, Beth has a $500 capital gain for the year from the sale of her Microsoft stock. She pays taxes on all $500 of this capital gain.</p>
<h5>With Tax Loss Harvesting</h5>
<p>Rather than continuing to hold her Apple stock, Beth can harvest her losses in Apple by selling before the year-end. Capital gains and losses get added together for the year resulting in either a net gain or loss. Her net capital gain is now only $200 for the year ($500 &#8211; $300). In this scenario, Beth only pays taxes on $200 of net capital gains rather than $500.</p>
<h4>All About Cryptocurrency Tax Loss Harvesting</h4>

<p>Cryptocurrencies are always treated as property for tax purposes, the same as traditional stocks. This means that you can strategically sell or trade crypto to harvest losses and reduce your tax liability. However, unlike stocks, cryptocurrencies have unique characteristics that make them even better candidates for tax loss harvesting.</p>
<h5>Wash Sale Rules</h5>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; white-space: normal; background-color: #ffffff;"> </span>A wash sale results when you sustain a capital loss and then repurchase the same security within 30-days. This is before or after the capital loss is incurred. It was designed to prevent investors from taking capital losses in one year and then immediately buying back the stock. The <a href="https://www.irs.gov/publications/p550#en_US_2016_publink100010601">IRS</a> states that the wash sale rules apply only to securities. It was deemed that Cryptocurrencies are property, and not securities, as defined by the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-21.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IRS guidance</a>. This means that currently, the wash sales rules do not apply to cryptocurrency.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Volatility</h5>
<ul>
<li>Cryptocurrencies are very volatile, more so than traditional assets. This volatility means that investors have extensive opportunities to realize and harvest capital losses. The problematic part for investors is identifying which of the cryptocurrencies (in their portfolios) have the highest cost basis (original purchase price) when they are compared to the current market price. These are the assets that present the most significant opportunity for tax savings.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Let’s look at another example:</h4>
<p>Alan has made $15,000 in capital gains from investing in the stock market this year. He has also been investing in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, XRP, and Ethereum. In December, he notices that his investments are down over $20,000 for the year. To harvest these losses, Alan trades all of his cryptocurrencies into Litecoin.  Thus incurring a <em>taxable event</em> and realizing his losses. Alan’s losses in cryptocurrency completely offset all of his stock market gains, and he then will have a capital loss for the year of $5000.</p>
<h4>Net Capital Losses Up to $3,000 Offset Ordinary Income</h4>
<ul>
<li>When total capital gains and losses for the year add up to a loss, a net capital loss is then incurred.</li>
<li>If the net capital loss is less than or equal to $3,000 ($1,500 if you are married and filing a separate tax return), then that entire capital loss can be used to offset other types of income &#8211; such as the job-related income.</li>
<li>Net losses exceeding $3,000 are rolled forward to subsequent years.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Sell or Trade Once Detected</h4>
<ul>
<li>Once you determine which cryptocurrencies present the best tax savings opportunities, you can then sell or trade them on your exchange of choice. You must understand that selling or trading your crypto will trigger a <em>taxable event</em> and “realize” your losses in the asset. December 31st is the deadline.</li>
</ul>
<p>The tax year ends on Dec. 31<sup>st</sup>, even though the filing deadline isn’t until April 15th. This means that you must realize your losses before the end of the year if you want them to impact that year’s taxes.</p>
<p>Many investors delay only to discover that they could have saved money on their tax bill if they would have sold or taken their losses in December. And by then it’s too late.</p>

			<h4>F is for First Time Penalty Abatement</h4>
<ul>
<li>The first time penalty abatement (FTA) waiver is an administrative waiver that the IRS may grant to relieve taxpayers from failure-to-file, failure-to-pay and failure-to-deposit penalties if certain criteria are met.</li>
<li>The IRS also removes interest related to those penalties.</li>
</ul>
<p>First Time Penalty Abatement is an option that may be available to taxpayers to remove IRS penalties that have been assessed to a tax debt. However, not everyone qualifies for penalty abatement. Also, not all penalties are eligible for penalty abatement. Some of the most common penalties that are able to be abated are failure to file, failure to pay, and failure to deposit estimated tax.</p>
<h5>You may qualify for administrative relief from penalties for failing to file a tax return, pay on time, and/or to deposit taxes when due under the IRS First Time Penalty Abatement policy if you meet the following:</h5>
<ul>
<li>A taxpayer didn’t previously have to file a return, or you have no penalties for the 3 tax years prior to the tax year in which you received a penalty.</li>
<li>You filed all currently required returns or filed an extension of time to file.</li>
<li>You have paid, or arranged to pay, any tax due.</li>
</ul>
<p>The failure-to-pay penalty will continue to accrue, until the tax is paid in full. It may be to your advantage to wait until you fully pay the tax due prior to requesting penalty relief under the Service&#8217;s first-time penalty abatement policy. The penalty is 5% of your balance per month.</p>
<p>Interest charged on a penalty will be reduced or removed when that penalty is reduced or removed. If an unpaid balance remains on your account, interest will continue to accrue until the account is full paid.</p>
<p>Other administrative relief: If you received incorrect oral advice from the IRS, you may qualify for administrative relief.</p>
<p>Determining whether a situation or event qualifies a taxpayer for penalty relief can be tricky. Seeking professional help from an Enrolled Agent and Certified Tax Resolution Specialist is helpful not only because the tax professional is familiar with the qualifications for penalty abatement, but also, they will know how to properly organize and submit your request.  Discover how to solve your tax problem by speaking with us today. <a href="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/media/"> Find out more about me</a>.

			<h4>2020, The Year You Deal With Your Back Taxes!</h4>
<p>Deal With Your Back Taxes. According to the IRS, more than 13.2 million Americans owe back taxes. The majority of these cases involve amounts that seem impossible to pay off.</p>
<p>That leaves those tax-owing folks in a difficult position. They want to pay, but they can&#8217;t, and the end result is feeling a lot of guilt about the situation.  There is no easy way to get out of paying your back taxes. Uncle Sam wants his money, and he&#8217;ll get it somehow.</p>
<p>There are steps you can take to find a solution and make 2020 the year you finally deal with your taxes.</p>
<p>Note, we always recommend getting in touch with a Certified Tax Resolution Specialist to negotiate with the IRS on your behalf. If you’d like to schedule a no-cost confidential tax relief consultation, contact us here. <a href="https://meetme.so/SFSTax"><strong>https://meetme.so/SFSTax</strong></a> or call 877.355.8010</p>
<h4><strong>Why Now Is the Right Time to Deal with Back Taxes</strong><strong><img class="alignright wp-image-4308" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Now-Is-the-Right-Time-to-Deal-with-Back-Taxes-1-300x158.png" alt="Deal With Your Back Taxes-finances-hpuse-sfstaxproblemsolutions" width="372" height="196" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Now-Is-the-Right-Time-to-Deal-with-Back-Taxes-1-300x158.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Now-Is-the-Right-Time-to-Deal-with-Back-Taxes-1-768x404.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Now-Is-the-Right-Time-to-Deal-with-Back-Taxes-1.png 1000w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Now-Is-the-Right-Time-to-Deal-with-Back-Taxes-1-700x368.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 372px) 100vw, 372px" /></strong></h4>
<p><strong>#1 You&#8217;ll End Up Owing Less</strong></p>
<p>The longer you wait to pay your back taxes, the more you are going to end up owing. That&#8217;s because the IRS can and will add penalties that can add up quickly.   The longer you drag out the situation, the more you&#8217;ll need to pay your tax resolution specialist to help you handle everything. The sooner you act, the sooner you can resolve the issue and the less you&#8217;ll have to pay.</p>
<p>If you need help from a CPA, Enrolled Agent or a lawyer who is also a tax resolution professional, look for someone that will charge you a flat fee rather than an hourly rate. Some cases take longer to resolve, so it’s important to know up front what you’ll be paying in service fees to get your back-tax issue resolved.</p>
<p><strong>#2 Housing prices are at an all-time high. Time to cash in?</strong></p>
<p>If you own your home or have equity in it, selling it and downsizing may be the best way to settle your tax debt and get a clean slate. Now is a perfect time, too, with housing prices at a premium in many areas of the country. You can use that cash in the bank to settle your back taxes almost immediately. Additionally, if your home is worth more than you owe, you can then reinvest that money or save it for a rainy day. That gives you a clean financial slate to start rebuilding your life.</p>
<p><strong>#3 Economic Uncertainty</strong></p>
<p>Most experts agree we’re due for a recession soon. How soon? Well, no one knows. What we do know is that having a large back tax bill will only hinder your ability to weather a storm in the event of an economic downturn.</p>
<p>You might be able to take a low interest loan out now that the economy is still good and settle your tax bill. Taking care of your taxes while the economy is still good will give you peace of mind and breathing room in case things go south with the economy.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Tax Resolution Alphabet -E is for (Tax) Evasion. Tax evasion occurs when a person or business illegally avoids paying their tax liability, which is a criminal charge that’s subject to penalties and fines.</p>
<h4><strong>Overview:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Tax evasion can be either the illegal non-payment or underpayment of actual tax liabilities due.</li>
<li>Tax evasion can be determined by the IRS regardless of whether or not tax forms were filed with the agency.</li>
<li>To determine tax evasion, the agency must be able to show that the avoidance of taxes was willful on the part of the taxpayer.</li>
<li>While tax evasion is illegal, tax avoidance includes finding legal ways (within the law) to reduce taxpayer obligations.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is tax evasion?</strong></h4>
<p>Tax evasion is an illegal activity in which a person or entity deliberately avoids paying a tax liability. Individuals caught evading taxes are usually subject to criminal charges and substantial penalties. To willfully fail to pay taxes is a federal offense under the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax code.</p>
<p>In order for charges to be levied, it must be determined that the avoidance of taxes was a willful act on the part of the taxpayer. Not only can a person be liable for payment of any taxes that have been left unpaid, but they can also be found guilty of criminal and civil charges and may be required to serve jail time. According to the IRS, the penalties include jail time of no more than five years, a fine of no more than $250,000 for individuals or $500,000 for corporations, or both—along with the costs of prosecution.</p>
<p>When determining if the act of failure to pay was intentional, a variety of factors are considered. Most commonly, a taxpayer’s financial situation will be examined in an effort to confirm if the nonpayment was the result of committing fraud or of the concealment of reportable income. Unlike in an audit where the burden of proof falls to the taxpayer, in a criminal situation the IRS/Department of Justice bears the burden.<img class="alignright  wp-image-4321" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/CID-shield-handcuffs-1040-form-300x158.png" alt="CID shield-handcuffs-1040 form" width="384" height="202" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/CID-shield-handcuffs-1040-form-300x158.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/CID-shield-handcuffs-1040-form-768x404.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/CID-shield-handcuffs-1040-form.png 1000w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/CID-shield-handcuffs-1040-form-700x368.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 384px) 100vw, 384px" /></p>
<h5><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_evasion_in_the_United_States">E is for (Tax) Evasion </a></h5>
<p>A failure to pay may be judged fraudulent in cases where a taxpayer made efforts to conceal assets by associating them with a person other than themselves. This can include reporting income under a false name and Social Security number (SSN), which can also constitute identity theft. A person may be judged as concealing income for failure to report work that did not follow traditional payment recording methods. This can include acceptance of a cash payment for goods or services rendered without reporting them properly to the IRS during a tax filing.</p>
<p>In most cases of<a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-utl/tax_crimes_handbook.pdf"> corporate tax evasion listed on the IRS website</a>, the tax liability was underrepresented. Many business owners undervalued the sums of their receipts to the agency, an act which was deemed to be the purposeful evasion of tax. These were documented to be sources of income, revenue, and profits that were not accurately reported.</p>
<p>Don’t let the burden of failure to file and owing <a href="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/the-tax-resolution-alphabet-b-is-for-back-taxes/">back taxes</a> hang over your head any longer.

			<h4><strong>The Tax Resolution Alphabet &#8211; D is for Debt Relief</strong></h4>
<p>If you are struggling with IRS tax debt and feel like it’s a hopeless situation, it may not be as  awful as you think. The IRS Fresh Start Program was created to make it easier and more accessible for people to repay or settle their tax debt.</p>
<p>Taxes often seem overwhelming and overly complex, almost like a project that you didn’t research and were unable to complete.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Fresh Start Program</strong></h5>
<p>The IRS initiated its Fresh Start Program in 2008 and expanded it in 2012 to ease the financial burdens of taxpayers who owe up to $50,000 in taxes. It is available to both business owners and individual taxpayers</p>
<p>The program is designed to allow taxpayers to pay off substantial tax debts affordably over the course of six years. Each month, taxpayers make payments that are based on their current income and the value of their liquid assets.</p>
<p>It simplifies the process of paying back large tax debts. It also helps people avoid many of the damages of owing a tax debt to the IRS including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accrued Interest</li>
<li>Recurring Penalties</li>
<li>Tax liens</li>
<li>Seizure of assets</li>
<li>Wage garnishments</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong> Qualifies for the Fresh Start Program?</strong></h5>
<p>In order to qualify for the IRS Fresh Start Program for debt settlement or lien withdrawals, generally you&#8217;ll need a couple of things at a minimum:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any missing or unfiled tax returns must be filed.</li>
<li>You are current with your estimated tax payments or your current withholdings are correct, and they have been so for the last 6 months.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Can the IRS ReallyTake My Money and Assets?</h5>

			<p style="text-align: left;">C is for the <em>Currently Not Collectible</em><em> </em><em>Status </em>from the IRS</p>
<p>Big companies are known for getting all sorts of breaks, but when average people fall behind, they rarely receive help. When you owe back taxes, but can’t afford to pay them, then you may qualify for a special tax status known as <em>currently not collectible</em>.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-4118 alignleft" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/C-is-for-currently-not-collectible-300x158.png" alt="" width="391" height="206" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/C-is-for-currently-not-collectible-300x158.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/C-is-for-currently-not-collectible-768x404.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/C-is-for-currently-not-collectible.png 1000w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/C-is-for-currently-not-collectible-700x368.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 391px) 100vw, 391px" /></p>
<p>If you’re IRS approved for currently not collectible status, they must not only cease its collection efforts, but they can no longer garnish your wages or seize your property.</p>
<p>Want to know if you qualify for currently not collectible status? Contact our firm here for a specific evaluation of your situation. <em>Visit our website, <a href="http://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/">sfstaxproblemsolutions.com</a> to book your <strong>Free Debt Settlement Analysis</strong> at </em><a href="https://go.oncehub.com/jeffreyschneider"><strong>https://go.oncehub.com/jeffreyschneider</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>What is Currently Not Collectible Status? </strong></p>
<p>If the IRS agrees that you can’t pay your back taxes and cover your reasonable living expenses, they may place your account in the Currently Not Collectible status.  This determination is based on your <img class="alignright wp-image-4111" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-300x300.png" alt="warning sign, do not try this alone" width="269" height="269" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-300x300.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-150x150.png 150w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-768x768.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-570x570.png 570w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-500x500.png 500w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-1000x1000.png 1000w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-700x700.png 700w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 269px) 100vw, 269px" />current financial situation.</p>
<p>You can request currently not collectible status by submitting the proper form and proof to the IRS of your income and expenses, as well as whether you can sell any assets you may have or get a loan.</p>
<p>As you’ll need to be able to document your inability to pay, be sure to gather copies of all your bills, your most recent paycheck stubs, and statements detailing other sources of income such as alimony, pensions or investments. If the IRS determines that your necessary expenses exceed your income, then it will notify you of your Currently Not Collectable status.</p>
<p>WARNING: Don’t try to do this alone. We recommend reaching out to our tax resolution firm to guide you through your options. Talking to the IRS directly could be like shooting yourself in the foot. They’ll ask you very invasive questions that could land you in deeper trouble. Remember, the IRS is not your friend. Their job is to collect what they believe you owe them, so it’s best to have a professional in your corner.</p>
<p><strong>Not a Permanent Solution</strong></p>
<p>Keep in mind that currently not collectible status applies only to your back taxes. You will still have to file tax returns, and you will not be exempted from paying current and future taxes. You will also continue to accumulate penalties and interest on your unpaid taxes. After a year or two, the IRS may review your status, and if you’re able to begin paying your back taxes, then you must do so. If you’re still not able to pay, then your status will be renewed.</p>
<p><strong>Statute of Limitations   </strong></p>
<p>The IRS can attempt to collect outstanding taxes for only ten years from the date the taxes were assessed against you; usually, that’s the date you filed. If at the end of this 10-year period the IRS hasn’t collected, then the taxes are no longer owed.</p>
<p>In difficult times, many families have trouble meeting their commitments. If you’re worried about the IRS garnishing your wages, levying your bank account, or taking your home, then reaching out to our firm and getting a free, no-obligation, confidential consultation on your tax problem may give you some peace of mind. If you’re not approved for Currently Not Collectible status, our firm will explain the many other tax relief options with you.

			<p><strong>Owe Money to the IRS? It&#8217;s Called Back Taxes</strong></p>
<p>Back taxes refer to taxes owed from a prior year.</p>
<p>A taxpayer may be behind in paying taxes for intentional or negligent reasons. Some of these reasons include – filing a return and failing to pay the tax liability; failing to report all income earned during the tax year, and; neglecting to file a tax return for a given tax year.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-4126 alignleft" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Do-you-suffer-from-FOF_Fear-of-Filing-300x300.png" alt="" width="211" height="211" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Do-you-suffer-from-FOF_Fear-of-Filing-300x300.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Do-you-suffer-from-FOF_Fear-of-Filing-150x150.png 150w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Do-you-suffer-from-FOF_Fear-of-Filing-768x768.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Do-you-suffer-from-FOF_Fear-of-Filing-570x570.png 570w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Do-you-suffer-from-FOF_Fear-of-Filing-500x500.png 500w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Do-you-suffer-from-FOF_Fear-of-Filing-700x700.png 700w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Do-you-suffer-from-FOF_Fear-of-Filing.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 211px) 100vw, 211px" /></p>
<p>If taxes remain unpaid after multiple notices have been sent by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), a minimum penalty fee of $135 will be charged in addition to interest on the unpaid amount, which is 0.5% per month that the taxpayer is late, up to 25%. As the total tax debt increases each month due to penalty and interest, over time, it can grow into a significant amount.</p>

We can file all of your deinquent returns and help you with the penalties and interest.  Contact our firm here for an evaluation of your situation. <em>Visit our website, <a href="http://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/">sfstaxproblemsolutions.com</a> to book your <strong>Free Debt Settlement Analysis</strong> at </em><a href="https://go.oncehub.com/jeffreyschneider"><strong>https://go.oncehub.com/jeffreyschneider.</strong></a></p>
<p>Unpaid back taxes can be a serious issue for many taxpayers who don&#8217;t have the means to pay them. Depending upon the circumstances, the government may take one of many strategies to deal with back taxes, such as pressing charges, demanding that that the taxpayer pay immediately, or sometimes offering a voluntary disclosure program which helps avoid criminal charges and allows a variety of payment options. Failure to pay taxes can also involve imprisonment.</p>
<p>In some cases, the IRS will seize property, seize assets, or place liens on property. The IRS may place a federal tax lien to inform other creditors of the taxing authorities legal right to a taxpayer’s assets and property. The IRS also has the power to garnish a taxpayer’s wages and to levy their financial accounts, seizing up to the total amount of taxes owed. If the taxes remain unpaid, the tax authority can use a tax levy to legally seize the taxpayer&#8217;s assets (such as bank accounts, investment accounts, automobiles, and real property) in order to collect the money, it is owed. While a lien secures the government’s interest or claim in an individual’s or business’ property when the tax debt remains unpaid, a levy actually permits the government to seize and sell the property in order to pay the tax debt.</p>

			<p>IRS Appeals</p>
<p>An unexpected envelope from the Internal Revenue Service is never a good thing.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s never pleasant, but any letter that you receive should not be ignored, especially if you disagree with an IRS decision.</p>
<p>In fact, the IRS Taxpayer Bill of Rights covers this specific situation as one of a taxpayer&#8217;s rights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay no more than the correct amount of tax,</li>
<li>Challenge the IRS&#8217; position and be heard and</li>
<li>Appeal an IRS decision in an independent forum</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some tips on getting through an IRS disagreement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get professional help: First, if you don&#8217;t have a tax professional, get one.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if your disputed tax situation is not that complicated, dealing with the IRS can be difficult. A tax professional that has standing with the IRS, like an Enrolled Agent (EA), CPA, or attorney with experience in resolving issues between the IRS and taxpayers can save you time, and money. A Certified Tax Resolution Specialist (CTRS) is specially trained to argue your case before the IRS.</p>
<ul>
<li>Know the general appeals process: Your tax pro will help you understand what to expect and what happens during your appeal process.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Appeals Office is separate from and independent of the IRS office that took action against you. It&#8217;s also the only level of administrative appeal within the IRS.</p>
<p>Conferences with an Appeals Office representative can be held informally by correspondence, telephone, or at a face-to-face meeting.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to have official representation at an appeals conference, but as noted at the beginning of this post, it&#8217;s generally a good idea.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4156" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IRS-letter-300x251.png" alt="IRS letter-sfs tax problem solutions" width="300" height="251" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IRS-letter-300x251.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IRS-letter-768x644.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IRS-letter-700x587.png 700w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IRS-letter.png 940w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Preparation is essential: If you do go to the Appeals Office, be prepared to discuss all issues you don&#8217;t agree with at the conference.</p>
<p>You also might need to file a formal written protest or a small case request with the office named in the IRS letter you received.</p>
<p>And definitely be sure to file your protest within the time limit specified in the letter you received.</p>
<p>Specifically, Appeals isn&#8217;t interested in and won&#8217;t accept any objection you have based on moral, religious, political, constitutional, conscientious, or similar grounds.</p>
<ul>
<li>Let the pros handle it: Your tax adviser can file the written protest for you.</li>
</ul>
<p>He or she also can take care of the discussions or hearings without you if you decide you just don&#8217;t want to go it alone.</p>
<p>If you do opt to skip the Appeal Office meeting and send only your lawyer, CPA or EA to make your case, be sure you have completed a power of attorney form allowing your representative to receive and inspect confidential information.</p>
<ul>
<li>Beyond Appeals: The IRS says that going through the Office of Appeals process generally settles most tax disputes without expensive and time-consuming court trials.</li>
</ul>
<p>If, however, that&#8217;s not the case in your tax disagreement, you can take your protest to the judicial level. This includes appeals to the United States Tax Court, the United States Court of Federal Claims or your United States District Court.</p>
<p>In difficult times, many families have trouble meeting their commitments. If you’re worried about the IRS garnishing your wages, levying your bank account, or taking your home,</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-4151" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tax-problems_-1-300x158.png" alt="IRS desk, man with pen, SFS" width="392" height="207" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tax-problems_-1-300x158.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tax-problems_-1-768x404.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tax-problems_-1.png 1000w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tax-problems_-1-700x368.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 392px) 100vw, 392px" /> then reaching out to our firm and getting a free, no-obligation, confidential consultation on your tax problem may give you some peace of mind.  Jeffrey Schneider, EA, CTRS is a tax expert and can work with you to file your back taxes and get you tax compliant.

<p>Though our firm specializes in helping people resolve their IRS or state back tax problems, we also love saving you money. After all, one of the best ways to avoid getting into tax trouble is to minimize your liabilities.</p>
<h2><strong><img class="alignright wp-image-2683" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Year-End-Tax-Saving-Strategies-girl-writing-sticky-notes.jpg" alt="" width="374" height="223" /></strong></h2>
<p>The end of the year is the perfect time to review your finances and the perfect time to make some smart tax-saving moves. Making the right moves at the end of the year can possibly reduce your tax liability and allow you to keep more of what you earn.</p>
<p>From accelerating expenses to boosting the amount you put away for retirement, there are things you can do to lower your tax burden. You may not be able to control the tax fight in Washington, but you can limit the amount you pay by assessing your own tax situation and making some prudent changes.</p>
<h2><strong>Accelerate Your Expenses</strong></h2>
<p>Individual taxpayers are on the cash basis for income tax purposes. This means your income is taxable when you receive it and expenses count when you pay them. Depending on your situation, shifting deductions between years can make a big difference on your tax bill. With this knowledge, making additional deductible payments prior to the end of the year may be a good idea. Examples include property tax payments, mortgage interest payments, and charitable donations.</p>
<h2><strong>Boost Your 401(k) Contributions </strong></h2>
<h2><strong><img class="alignright wp-image-2684" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Year-End-Tax-Saving-Strategies-girl-writing-white-board.jpg" alt="Year-End Tax Saving Strategies, girl, writing, white board" width="604" height="903" /></strong></h2>
<p>As the year ticks down to its close, it pays to look at your most recent pay stub and see how much you have already contributed to your 401(k) plan. Contributing to a 401(k) plan is an excellent way to save on taxes since every dollar you put in is deducted from your taxable income.</p>
<p>For 2018, you can contribute up to $18,500 to your 401(k) plan, plus an extra 6,000  if you are 50 or older. Also, if you have not yet maxed out your 401(k), now is the perfect time to boost your contributions and make up for lost time.  Keep in mind that many companies allow you to change your contribution percentage any time you wish. Boosting the amount you put in between now and the end of the year can make a huge difference. You can adjust your contribution downward in the new year if you wish, but at least consider leaving it at its new elevated level.</p>
<h2><strong>Gather Your Donations</strong></h2>
<p style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 200%; font-family: 'Microsoft Sans Serif','sans-serif';">Donating to charity makes you feel good, but it can also be good for your wallet. If you itemize your deductions, you may be able to take a deduction for not only cash contributions but gifts of household goods and clothing as well.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 200%; font-family: 'Microsoft Sans Serif','sans-serif';">Take a few minutes this weekend to go through your closets and storage areas. First, look for usable items you no longer need. Box them up and take them down to your local thrift store or other charity. Be sure to get a receipt that shows what you donated, along with the approximate value. </span></p>
<h2><strong>Contact Your Enrolled Agent</strong></h2>
<p style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 200%; font-family: 'Microsoft Sans Serif','sans-serif';">This is a short list of some of the ideas you can use to lower your tax obligation in 2018. If you need an expert tax resolution professional, reach out to us and we’ll schedule a no-obligation confidential consultation. Jeffrey Schneider, EA, CTRS will explain your options and help permanently resolve your tax problem.</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Crypto Tax: IRS Catching Investors Who Don&#8217;t Pay Taxes</h2>
<p>Those who invest in Cryptocurrency may not be aware that there is a tax on Crypto, just like everything else in the world. Cryptocurrency investors have mostly flown under the radar as far as taxes are concerned. Now those days are coming to an end, and many of those with digital wallets are scrambling to understand what they owe and how their investments may impact their finances.</p>
<p>The IRS is already on top of discovering the identities of those who hold substantial amounts of cryptocurrency, and it is only a matter of time until the tax agency broadens its scope. Just as with <a href="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/irs-forces-full-disclosure-for-overseas-accounts/">overseas bank accounts,</a> the days of free riding in the crypto market are quickly coming to an end.</p>
<p>When the veil of secrecy got pierced for holders of Swiss bank accounts, people all over the world were shocked &#8212; and suddenly a lot poorer. Crypto fans have primarily relied on the supposed anonymity of their investments to protect themselves. However, recent events have shown that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are not entirely as anonymous as advertised. It may be time to visit your enrolled agent, because it is certainly time to get out ahead of the situation.</p>
<p>Here are some tax tips for cryptocurrency investors.</p>
<h3><strong>Do Not Assume Your Account is Too Small<img class="alignright wp-image-1864" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/An-Investment-More-Important-Than-Crypto-The-Tax-the-irs-is-coming-for-you-beach-litecoin-sand-hourglass.jpg" alt="An Investment More Important Than Crypto- The Tax, the irs is coming for you, beach, litecoin, sand, hourglass" width="298" height="163" /></strong></h3>
<p>If you only have a few hundred dollars in the cryptocurrency market, you may assume that your account is too small to get the attention of the IRS. However, that is not necessarily the case. They are going to rapidly get better at sorting out the records of cryptocurrency exchanges. Pretty soon, they will likely expand their reach beyond the most significant players in the marketplace.</p>
<p>Before you know it, more and more cryptocurrency investors will become ensnared in the net of the IRS.</p>
<h3><strong>Know that All Cryptocurrencies Will Be Impacted Eventually</strong></h3>
<p>Bitcoin is the first and &#8211; by far &#8211; the most significant crypto tax target. The IRS will start poking around in other forms of virtual payment. Some cryptocurrencies may carry considerably detrimental IRS consequences. For example, there are forms of payment associated with drug purchases and other transactions on the dark web. Even if you are not doing anything wrong, your holdings in those altcoins could get the attention of the IRS and eventually generate a big tax bill.</p>
<h3><strong>Keep Careful Records</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-1865" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/An-Investment-More-Important-Than-Crypto-The-Tax-the-irs-is-coming-for-you-handheld-smartphone.jpg" alt="An Investment More Important Than Crypto- The Tax, the irs is coming for you, handheld, smartphone" width="275" height="179" />Keeping extensive and accurate records will be essential going forward. Also, you might want to go back and look at your past purchases and sales. Every transaction, including purchases using cryptocurrency as payment, could potentially be a taxable event, so good recordkeeping is vital.</p>
<p>The tax man is coming eventually, and the best thing you can do is prepare now. Waiting until the IRS catches you could mean big penalties and additional interest. The best strategy is to find a professional, like Jeffrey Schneider, EA, CTRS, that has the expertise and licensing to practice throughout the United States. He can resolve any issues involving your cryptocurrencies.</p>
