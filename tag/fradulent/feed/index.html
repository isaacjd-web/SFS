<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Miami-Dade Police Officer Arrested for Stealing Thousands in Federal Funds While in College</strong></h2>
<p>Ebony Nesbitt’s tax fraud past may have caught up with her. Fraudulent tax refunds are practically unforgivable with the IRS. If she is convicted, the choices she made in college will severely impact her future.  She was relieved of duty without pay from the Miami-Dade Police Force and may serve up to 15 years in prison.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-1921" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Miami-Dade-Police-Officer-Arrested-for-Stealing-Thousands-in-Federal-Funds-While-in-College-girl-college-library.jpg" alt="Miami-Dade Police Officer Arrested for Stealing Thousands in Federal Funds While in College, girl, college, library" width="269" height="200" /></p>
<p>When Nesbitt was attending Miami-Dade College in 2013, federal prosecutors say she joined a ring of students who stole other people&#8217;s identities to file fake tax returns seeking nearly $2 million in refunds. Nesbitt and many others received thousands of dollars in their college bank accounts.</p>
<p>She was not among the 18 MDC students arrested in 2014 as the U.S. attorney&#8217;s office froze more than 1,000 student bank accounts used to deposit fraudulently obtained tax refunds. The ring filed returns in the names of about 650 taxpayers whose Social Security numbers were stolen. As a result, the IRS issued almost $500,000 in refunds.</p>
<p>Four years after the college scandal, Nesbitt serves as a Miami-Dade police officer. But not for long, because the 28-year-old North Miami woman was arrested. She received charges of a conspiracy against the U.S. government and theft of federal funds.</p>
<h3><strong>Results Pending</strong></h3>
<p>They released Nesbitt on a $50,000 bond. The police force also relieved her of duty without pay pending the outcome of her criminal case. Nesbitt joined the police force in 2014 and sadly enough, this was not her first time in the news.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-1919" title="Miami-Dade Police Officer Arrested for Stealing Thousands in Federal Funds While in College, court, judge, gavel" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Miami-Dade-Police-Officer-Arrested-for-Stealing-Thousands-in-Federal-Funds-While-in-College-court-judge-gavel.jpg" alt="Miami-Dade Police Officer Arrested for Stealing Thousands in Federal Funds While in College, court, judge, gavel" width="164" height="197" />The case by the FBI and U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office was made as the statute of limitations was going to expire. In a separate but recent incident, Nesbitt&#8217;s former boyfriend, Andrew Morales, was charged with two counts of theft of government funds. Morales received two electronic tax refunds from the Treasury Department. He received $7,568 and $9,353 &#8211; both in the names of other people. Seems a little fishy…</p>
<h3><strong>How She Did It</strong></h3>
<p>Nesbitt and her co-conspirators obtained the names, dates of birth and Social Security numbers of other people for filing bogus tax returns &#8211; then arranged to have the electronic refunds deposited into the Higher One bank accounts of Miami Dade College students. Those accounts are for receiving financial aid and paying tuition.</p>
<p>Nesbitt and her co-conspirators &#8220;designated&#8221; her Higher One account for the direct deposit of federal tax refunds. On Oct. 2, 2013, Nesbitt&#8217;s account received a wire transfer totaling $7,573 from the Treasury Department in the name of another person.</p>
<p>That same day, an unnamed co-conspirator withdrew about $502 from Nesbitt&#8217;s Higher One account. She used a debit card in her name. Eight days later, Nesbitt received a check totaling $7,068.50 from Higher One when the banking-service company closed her Miami Dade College account.</p>
