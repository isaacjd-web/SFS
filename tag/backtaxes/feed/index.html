			<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">After years of flying under the radar, taxpayers who hold Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and other cryptocurrencies are finally getting scrutinized by the IRS its time to come clean about taxes on cryptocurrency. The IRS has determined that cryptocurrency is here to stay and that the outrageous refunds that early adopters have enjoyed could be a massive windfall for government coffers.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">The tax agency has also figured out that many earliest adopters to late comers who are holders of crypto could owe a lot of money on these assets. The currency may be virtual, but to the IRS, the taxes that are due are all too real.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">Note &#8211; if you think you might owe back taxes on your crypto, we encourage all readers to contact us at </span><a href="http://bit.ly/2Hh7cEl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><span style="color: #0e101a;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://bit.ly/2Hh7cE</span>l</span></em></a><span style="color: #0e101a;">. Contact us today for a free, no-obligation, confidential consultation.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">The Illusion of Anonymity</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">If you have been skating along under the veil of anonymity and failing to report your cryptocurrency holdings, you might want to rethink your strategy. After years of taking a mostly hands-off approach, the IRS is catching up in a big way. The agency is pulling out all the stops to recover the money the government believes is owed to them.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">Many holders of cryptocurrency are under the mistaken impression that their transactions are totally anonymous, and that there is no way for the IRS, or anyone else, to tell how much they hold or how they use their virtual coins. That may be a soothing fiction, but the reality is far different.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">The truth is that the IRS has a wide range of options at its disposal. From official form filings to subpoenas and legal documents, to pierce the veil of anonymity and find the real-world identities of cryptocurrency holders.</span></p>
<h5><strong><img class="alignright wp-image-4821" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IRS-form-1099-K-2020-300x158.png" alt="come clean about taxes on cryptocurrency- form 1099K" width="532" height="280" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IRS-form-1099-K-2020-300x158.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IRS-form-1099-K-2020-768x404.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IRS-form-1099-K-2020.png 1000w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IRS-form-1099-K-2020-700x368.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 532px) 100vw, 532px" />Did You Get a 1099-K? Well, So Did the IRS</strong></h5>
<p>In some cases, holders of cryptocurrency are finding tax forms in their mailboxes. If you receive this form, you can be sure the IRS received a copy as well.</p>
<p>When you file your taxes, an automatic matching program will compare the amount you claimed with the amount on these automatically generated forms. If there is a mismatch, you will hear from the IRS.</p>
<p>One of the most common forms used to report cryptocurrency holdings and transactions is the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/understanding-your-form-1099-k">1099-K</a>. For sellers on eBay and some freelancers, this form will already be familiar. Still, it is being extended into the virtual world as well. If you receive a 1099-K form this year, it is time to come clean with your cryptocurrency holdings.</p>
<h5><strong>The Cryptocurrency Question and Your Tax Form</strong></h5>
<p>Until now, cryptocurrency holders could and often did, plead ignorance. They could claim they did not realize their Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other virtual holdings were taxable. They could back up that assertion by saying the IRS never asked them about these assets. Time to come clean about taxes on cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>The validity of that excuse may have been questionable. Now that thin veil of supposed ignorance will be gone. Beginning with the 2019 tax return, taxpayers will be asked directly on their 1040 if they bought, sold, transacted, or otherwise acquired any cryptocurrency. They will be expected to answer that question truthfully.</p>
<p>The wording of this question means anyone who holds any cryptocurrency would be required to answer in the affirmative. Even so, merely holding virtual coins in a cryptocurrency wallet does not necessarily imply any taxes will be due. Someone who holds cryptocurrency but makes no transactions should not owe any taxes just as a holder of stock does not owe taxes until they sell the shares.</p>
<p>Come clean about taxes on cryptocurrency as the IRS is getting serious about cryptocurrency, drawn by a combination of past returns, unreported taxes, and increased exposure of these alternative forms of payment.</p>

			<p style="text-align: left;">C is for the <em>Currently Not Collectible</em><em> </em><em>Status </em>from the IRS</p>
<p>Big companies are known for getting all sorts of breaks, but when average people fall behind, they rarely receive help. When you owe back taxes, but can’t afford to pay them, then you may qualify for a special tax status known as <em>currently not collectible</em>.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-4118 alignleft" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/C-is-for-currently-not-collectible-300x158.png" alt="" width="391" height="206" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/C-is-for-currently-not-collectible-300x158.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/C-is-for-currently-not-collectible-768x404.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/C-is-for-currently-not-collectible.png 1000w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/C-is-for-currently-not-collectible-700x368.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 391px) 100vw, 391px" /></p>
<p>If you’re IRS approved for currently not collectible status, they must not only cease its collection efforts, but they can no longer garnish your wages or seize your property.</p>

<p><strong>What is Currently Not Collectible Status? </strong></p>
<p>If the IRS agrees that you can’t pay your back taxes and cover your reasonable living expenses, they may place your account in the Currently Not Collectible status.  This determination is based on your <img class="alignright wp-image-4111" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-300x300.png" alt="warning sign, do not try this alone" width="269" height="269" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-300x300.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-150x150.png 150w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-768x768.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-570x570.png 570w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-500x500.png 500w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-1000x1000.png 1000w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-700x700.png 700w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 269px) 100vw, 269px" />current financial situation.</p>
<p>You can request currently not collectible status by submitting the proper form and proof to the IRS of your income and expenses, as well as whether you can sell any assets you may have or get a loan.</p>
<p>As you’ll need to be able to document your inability to pay, be sure to gather copies of all your bills, your most recent paycheck stubs, and statements detailing other sources of income such as alimony, pensions or investments. If the IRS determines that your necessary expenses exceed your income, then it will notify you of your Currently Not Collectable status.</p>
<p>WARNING: Don’t try to do this alone. We recommend reaching out to our tax resolution firm to guide you through your options. Talking to the IRS directly could be like shooting yourself in the foot. They’ll ask you very invasive questions that could land you in deeper trouble. Remember, the IRS is not your friend. Their job is to collect what they believe you owe them, so it’s best to have a professional in your corner.</p>
<p><strong>Not a Permanent Solution</strong></p>
<p>Keep in mind that currently not collectible status applies only to your back taxes. You will still have to file tax returns, and you will not be exempted from paying current and future taxes. You will also continue to accumulate penalties and interest on your unpaid taxes. After a year or two, the IRS may review your status, and if you’re able to begin paying your back taxes, then you must do so. If you’re still not able to pay, then your status will be renewed.</p>
<p><strong>Statute of Limitations   </strong></p>
<p>The IRS can attempt to collect outstanding taxes for only ten years from the date the taxes were assessed against you; usually, that’s the date you filed. If at the end of this 10-year period the IRS hasn’t collected, then the taxes are no longer owed.</p>
<p>In difficult times, many families have trouble meeting their commitments. If you’re worried about the IRS garnishing your wages, levying your bank account, or taking your home, then reaching out to our firm and getting a free, no-obligation, confidential consultation on your tax problem may give you some peace of mind. If you’re not approved for Currently Not Collectible status, our firm will explain the many other tax relief options with you.

			<p><strong>Owe Money to the IRS? It&#8217;s Called Back Taxes</strong></p>
<p>Back taxes refer to taxes owed from a prior year.</p>
<p>A taxpayer may be behind in paying taxes for intentional or negligent reasons. Some of these reasons include – filing a return and failing to pay the tax liability; failing to report all income earned during the tax year, and; neglecting to file a tax return for a given tax year.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-4126 alignleft" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Do-you-suffer-from-FOF_Fear-of-Filing-300x300.png" alt="" width="211" height="211" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Do-you-suffer-from-FOF_Fear-of-Filing-300x300.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Do-you-suffer-from-FOF_Fear-of-Filing-150x150.png 150w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Do-you-suffer-from-FOF_Fear-of-Filing-768x768.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Do-you-suffer-from-FOF_Fear-of-Filing-570x570.png 570w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Do-you-suffer-from-FOF_Fear-of-Filing-500x500.png 500w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Do-you-suffer-from-FOF_Fear-of-Filing-700x700.png 700w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Do-you-suffer-from-FOF_Fear-of-Filing.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 211px) 100vw, 211px" /></p>
<p>If taxes remain unpaid after multiple notices have been sent by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), a minimum penalty fee of $135 will be charged in addition to interest on the unpaid amount, which is 0.5% per month that the taxpayer is late, up to 25%. As the total tax debt increases each month due to penalty and interest, over time, it can grow into a significant amount.</p>
<p>Do you have FOF, fear of filing? We can file all of your deinquent returns and help you with the penalties and interest.  Contact our firm here for an evaluation of your situation. <em>Visit our website, <a href="http://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/">sfstaxproblemsolutions.com</a> to book your <strong>Free Debt Settlement Analysis</strong> at </em><a href="https://go.oncehub.com/jeffreyschneider"><strong>https://go.oncehub.com/jeffreyschneider.</strong></a></p>
<p>Unpaid back taxes can be a serious issue for many taxpayers who don&#8217;t have the means to pay them. Depending upon the circumstances, the government may take one of many strategies to deal with back taxes, such as pressing charges, demanding that that the taxpayer pay immediately, or sometimes offering a voluntary disclosure program which helps avoid criminal charges and allows a variety of payment options. Failure to pay taxes can also involve imprisonment.</p>
<p>In some cases, the IRS will seize property, seize assets, or place liens on property. The IRS may place a federal tax lien to inform other creditors of the taxing authorities legal right to a taxpayer’s assets and property. The IRS also has the power to garnish a taxpayer’s wages and to levy their financial accounts, seizing up to the total amount of taxes owed. If the taxes remain unpaid, the tax authority can use a tax levy to legally seize the taxpayer&#8217;s assets (such as bank accounts, investment accounts, automobiles, and real property) in order to collect the money, it is owed. While a lien secures the government’s interest or claim in an individual’s or business’ property when the tax debt remains unpaid, a levy actually permits the government to seize and sell the property in order to pay the tax debt.</p>

			<p>You may have heard on the radio, T.V., and online, that you can settle your tax bill for less than what you owe. But are these claims really true? And can you settle your tax debt without hurting yourself in the long run?</p>
<p>Some of the national tax resolution firms you hear advertising offer minimal service, take a look at their Google and Yelp Reviews. So, it&#8217;s essential to know who you can trust and educate yourself on what your options are available to resolve your tax problem.</p>
<p>SFS Tax Problem Solutions is a specialty tax resolution firm. We encourage all of our readers that are facing a tax problem or know someone that is to contact us for a complimentary consultation.</p>
<p>The truth is that it&#8217;s often way more complicated than these big companies claim to negotiate a settlement for less than you owe the IRS, but it is possible. You must first learn if you qualify for the program. The program is known as an &#8220;offer in compromise,&#8221; but settling is not necessarily a bad thing.</p>
<p>An &#8220;offer in compromise&#8221; is a negotiated settlement between the taxpayer and the IRS that is intended to help taxpayers who owe more than they can pay. In many cases, you can settle your entire tax bill for a fraction of what you owe, if you qualify. You can only qualify if you genuinely can&#8217;t afford to pay back taxes or if doing so would cause extreme hardship. (i.e., if you have become disabled).</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-3907 size-medium" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/104a-tax-form-300x216.png" alt="" width="300" height="216" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/104a-tax-form-300x216.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/104a-tax-form.png 548w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />You also must be current on all legally required income tax returns and any estimated tax payments that you are required to make if you are self-employed. Nor can you be filing for bankruptcy.</p>
<p>The IRS would prefer to take an offer in compromise than send you to collections and potentially get less money. Taking an offer in compromise will NOT affect your credit score. Having your offer in compromise accepted is a far better financial decision in the long run.</p>
<p>However, working out what offer to make on your own and learning the whole process can be extremely challenging. That&#8217;s like representing yourself in a court of law without a lawyer. Not smart. A better answer is to find a tax resolution specialist that can help you with the process to see if you qualify and determine what you will have to pay. A CTRS, Certified Tax Resolution Specialist tax resolution specialist will also be a licensed CPA, Enrolled Agent, or an Attorney.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of working with a qualified and local tax resolution firm is that you get protection from the overbearing IRS. Whereby you will sleep better at night knowing you&#8217;re on your way towards a permanent tax solution. Additionally, the tax resolution expert can head-off any impending garnishments of your paycheck or levies on your bank account.</p>
<p>Settling with the IRS is a good thing and is often the best answer to dealing with your back-tax bill and moving on with your life.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-3908 size-medium" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2019-taxpayer-roadmap-300x296.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="296" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2019-taxpayer-roadmap-300x296.jpg 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2019-taxpayer-roadmap.jpg 611w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />If you want an expert tax resolution professional who knows how to navigate the IRS maze, reach out to our firm, and we&#8217;ll schedule a no-obligation confidential consultation to explain your options to resolve your tax problem permanently.</p>

			<p>There have been a lot of stories about surprised taxpayers this year, and many of those surprises were decidedly unpleasant. Taxpayers who had received large refunds for years were shocked to find that they owed the IRS money this year, sometimes thousands of dollars in additional taxes due. Let&#8217;s face it, nobody likes a surprise tax bill.</p>
<h3><strong><img class="alignright wp-image-3869" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Steps-to-Take-if-You-Received-a-Surprise-Tax-Bill-mailbox-surprise-mail.jpg" alt="" width="613" height="533" /></strong></h3>
<p>Still others were shocked to find an IRS notice in their mailboxes &#8211; a formal letter detailing an additional tax liability and demanding payment for taxes due. These IRS notices can leave even the most conscientious tax filer blindsided &#8211; and wondering what to do next.</p>
<p>Whether you expected a refund and received a bill or found a notice from the IRS lurking in your mailbox, what you do next matters a great deal. Here are some critical steps to take if you owe money to the IRS.</p>
<h3><strong>Stop Panicking</strong></h3>
<p>There is no scarier piece of mail than a notice from the IRS, especially if that notice comes with a big tax bill attached. Even so, a notification of additional taxes due is no excuse to panic, and worrying will not make the problem go away.</p>
<p>So calm down, think rationally and plan your next steps carefully. There are right and wrong ways to address the issue, and the steps you take next could make all the difference.</p>
<h3><strong>Double-Check Your Math and Gather Your Documents</strong></h3>
<p>Something as simple as a transposed number or mismatched form could trigger a notice from the IRS, but the good news is these problems can be easy to resolve. Before you do anything else, go back to your original documents and double-check your numbers.</p>
<p>Compare the 1099 forms and W2s you received with the numbers you entered on your return. If there are inconsistencies and errors, you may be able to simply file an amended return and resolve the issue.</p>
<h3><strong>Contact a Tax Resolution Firm</strong></h3>
<p>Your tax preparer can be a big help when you receive an audit notice or demand for additional taxes from the IRS, but chances are they won’t know how to negotiate with the IRS nor will they fully understand your options for tax relief.</p>
<p>Working with a firm that specializes in tax debt relief and tax resolution, you’ll be able to map out a plan to get your back taxes taken care of.</p>
<h3><strong>Ask About Possible Penalty Forgiveness <img class="alignright wp-image-3870" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Steps-to-Take-if-You-Received-a-Surprise-Tax-Bill-administration-adult-girl-reading-papers.jpg" alt="" width="533" height="528" /></strong></h3>
<p>Changes to the tax code have left many taxpayers owing money to the IRS when they expected to be cashing big refund checks. The limitations in the deductibility of state and local taxes, coupled with updates to the withholding tables, have left millions of taxpayers in this situation.</p>
<p>The IRS has taken notice, and the tax agency has been waiving underpayment penalties and interest for many of the affected taxpayers. If you are completing your tax return and find that you owe money to the IRS, ask us about possible waivers for part of the amount due. You will still be responsible for the taxes you owe, but you may be able to get relief from any penalties and interest.</p>
<p>Owing money to the IRS is frightening, but the tax agency is not entirely lacking in compassion. The IRS knows that many taxpayers will have trouble making their payments in full, and the agency may be willing to set up a more affordable payment plan.</p>
<h3><strong>Seek Payment Arrangements with the IRS</strong></h3>
<p>If you receive a surprise tax bill you should try to pay what you owe, assuming it’s correct and your tax preparer already lowered your tax liability to the lowest amount allowed by law.</p>
<p>If you are unable to pay what you owe, contact our firm and we can help you setup a properly structured payment plan that can save you a lot in the long run.</p>
<p>Keep in mind you could be on the hook for additional penalties, as well as interest on your outstanding balance.</p>
<p>Owing money to the IRS is scary, and having a large tax liability can wreak havoc with your finances and your life. Even so, there are things you can do to ease the burden, so you can pay what you owe and send the IRS on its way. The steps outlined above can help you get a handle on the situation, so you can rest easy and stop worrying about your tax bill.</p>
<p>If you want an expert tax resolution professional who knows how to navigate the IRS maze, reach out to our firm and we’ll schedule a no-obligation confidential consultation to explain your options to permanently resolve your tax problem.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Shakira Pays $25 Million in Back Taxes</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://people.com/tag/shakira/">Shakira</a> has reportedly paid a major bill for back taxes owed to the Spanish government.</p>
<p>According to numerous reports, this international superstar has paid more than 20 million Euros &#8211; or $25 million &#8211; to the Spanish authorities to settle part of a tax fraud debt pending ongoing investigation.</p>
<p>The investigation seeks to establish whether Shakira legally resided in Spain with her longtime boyfriend, Barcelona Futbol Club soccer player Gerard Piqué, between the years 2011 and 2014.<img class="alignright  wp-image-2302" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Shakira-Pays-25-Million-in-Back-Taxes.jpg" alt="Shakira Pays $25 Million in Back Taxes, Barcelona, architecture, building, ancient" width="303" height="265" /></p>
<p>Spanish law states that if an individual spends more than 183 days in the country, they are considered a legal resident and liable for paying taxes on income acquired internationally. However, those spending fewer than 183 days in Spain would only be accountable for income earned within the country.</p>
<h3>The Defense Has Spoken</h3>
<p>Shakira, 41, reportedly claimed that she had spent the majority of those years as a resident of the Bahamas. She claims to have filed her taxes accordingly. In documents obtained by both <em>El Periodico</em> and <em>El Pais,</em> the singer’s defense claimed that she had indeed spent most of her time abroad, and made no effort to intentionally hide her income, citing any misunderstandings as “a difference in criteria.”</p>
<p>It was confirmed that in 2009, Shakira relocated her intellectual property rights and brands to a company based in Malta. Malta is known for and has faced allegations of being a tax heaven.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-2301" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Shakira-Pays-25-Million-in-Back-Taxes-shakira-court-courtroom-stressed.jpg" alt="Shakira Pays $25 Million in Back Taxes, shakira, court, courtroom, stressed" width="270" height="176" />Spanish press reports have detailed extensive efforts of local tax authorities to establish Shakira’s place of residence during the years in question. They’ve begun studying photos of the star out and about in Spain to piece together her story. They even interviewed her hairstylist.</p>
<p>Shakira’s reported payment covers the amount owed for 2011, while the investigation into taxes owed for 2012-2014 remains ongoing, <em>El Periodico </em>claims. Once completed, the district attorney and the Agencia Estatal de Administración Tributaria (Spanish Tax Agency; their equivalence of our Internal Revenue Service) are expected to decide if tax fraud charges will be brought. Then, the case will proceed to court.</p>
<h3><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h3>
<p>If she did commit tax fraud, Shakira would join a <a href="https://www.thetaxdefensegroup.com/five-famous-people-who-committed-tax-fraud/">list</a> of celebrities who have been in trouble with tax authorities.</p>
