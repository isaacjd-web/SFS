			<p>There have been a lot of stories about surprised taxpayers this year, and many of those surprises were decidedly unpleasant. Taxpayers who had received large refunds for years were shocked to find that they owed the IRS money this year, sometimes thousands of dollars in additional taxes due. Let&#8217;s face it, nobody likes a surprise tax bill.</p>
<h3><strong><img class="alignright wp-image-3869" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Steps-to-Take-if-You-Received-a-Surprise-Tax-Bill-mailbox-surprise-mail.jpg" alt="" width="613" height="533" /></strong></h3>
<p>Still others were shocked to find an IRS notice in their mailboxes &#8211; a formal letter detailing an additional tax liability and demanding payment for taxes due. These IRS notices can leave even the most conscientious tax filer blindsided &#8211; and wondering what to do next.</p>
<p>Whether you expected a refund and received a bill or found a notice from the IRS lurking in your mailbox, what you do next matters a great deal. Here are some critical steps to take if you owe money to the IRS.</p>
<h3><strong>Stop Panicking</strong></h3>
<p>There is no scarier piece of mail than a notice from the IRS, especially if that notice comes with a big tax bill attached. Even so, a notification of additional taxes due is no excuse to panic, and worrying will not make the problem go away.</p>
<p>So calm down, think rationally and plan your next steps carefully. There are right and wrong ways to address the issue, and the steps you take next could make all the difference.</p>
<h3><strong>Double-Check Your Math and Gather Your Documents</strong></h3>
<p>Something as simple as a transposed number or mismatched form could trigger a notice from the IRS, but the good news is these problems can be easy to resolve. Before you do anything else, go back to your original documents and double-check your numbers.</p>
<p>Compare the 1099 forms and W2s you received with the numbers you entered on your return. If there are inconsistencies and errors, you may be able to simply file an amended return and resolve the issue.</p>
<h3><strong>Contact a Tax Resolution Firm</strong></h3>
<p>Your tax preparer can be a big help when you receive an audit notice or demand for additional taxes from the IRS, but chances are they won’t know how to negotiate with the IRS nor will they fully understand your options for tax relief.</p>
<p>Working with a firm that specializes in tax debt relief and tax resolution, you’ll be able to map out a plan to get your back taxes taken care of.</p>
<h3><strong>Ask About Possible Penalty Forgiveness <img class="alignright wp-image-3870" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Steps-to-Take-if-You-Received-a-Surprise-Tax-Bill-administration-adult-girl-reading-papers.jpg" alt="" width="533" height="528" /></strong></h3>
<p>Changes to the tax code have left many taxpayers owing money to the IRS when they expected to be cashing big refund checks. The limitations in the deductibility of state and local taxes, coupled with updates to the withholding tables, have left millions of taxpayers in this situation.</p>
<p>The IRS has taken notice, and the tax agency has been waiving underpayment penalties and interest for many of the affected taxpayers. If you are completing your tax return and find that you owe money to the IRS, ask us about possible waivers for part of the amount due. You will still be responsible for the taxes you owe, but you may be able to get relief from any penalties and interest.</p>
<p>Owing money to the IRS is frightening, but the tax agency is not entirely lacking in compassion. The IRS knows that many taxpayers will have trouble making their payments in full, and the agency may be willing to set up a more affordable payment plan.</p>
<h3><strong>Seek Payment Arrangements with the IRS</strong></h3>
<p>If you receive a surprise tax bill you should try to pay what you owe, assuming it’s correct and your tax preparer already lowered your tax liability to the lowest amount allowed by law.</p>
<p>If you are unable to pay what you owe, contact our firm and we can help you setup a properly structured payment plan that can save you a lot in the long run.</p>
<p>Keep in mind you could be on the hook for additional penalties, as well as interest on your outstanding balance.</p>
<p>Owing money to the IRS is scary, and having a large tax liability can wreak havoc with your finances and your life. Even so, there are things you can do to ease the burden, so you can pay what you owe and send the IRS on its way. The steps outlined above can help you get a handle on the situation, so you can rest easy and stop worrying about your tax bill.</p>
<p>If you want an expert tax resolution professional who knows how to navigate the IRS maze, reach out to our firm and we’ll schedule a no-obligation confidential consultation to explain your options to permanently resolve your tax problem.</p>

<p>Did you know, as a taxpayer, you have your own Bill of Rights? The IRS has adopted a Taxpayer Bill of Rights for all of their dealings with the IRS. Chapter 5 of <em>Now What? The IRS is Taking Everything I Own. Help!</em> goes over all ten and what they mean for you. We put together a little summary.</p>
<h2><strong>I. The Right to Be Informed</strong></h2>
<p>Taxpayers have the right to know what they need to do to comply with the tax laws. They are entitled to clear explanations of the law and IRS procedures in all tax forms.</p>
<h2><strong>II. The Right to Quality Service <img class="alignright wp-image-3640 " src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/The-Protection-and-Fundamental-Rights-You-Have-with-the-IRS-The-Taxpayer-Bill-of-Rights-sfs-sfstax-jeffrey-schneider-now-what-help-mailbox-us-mail-1.jpg" alt="" width="523" height="407" /></strong></h2>
<p>Taxpayers have the right to receive prompt, courteous, and professional assistance in their dealings with the IRS, to be spoken to in a way they can easily understand, to receive clear and easily understandable communications from the IRS, and to have a way to file complaints about inadequate service.</p>
<h2><strong>III. The Right to Pay No More than the Correct Amount of Tax</strong></h2>
<p>Taxpayers have the right to pay only the amount of tax legally due and to have the IRS apply all tax payments properly.</p>
<h2><strong>IV. The Right to Challenge the IRS’ Position and Be Heard</strong></h2>
<p>Taxpayers have the right to raise objections and provide additional documentation in response to formal IRS actions or proposed actions, to expect that the IRS will fairly consider their timely objections and documentation promptly and fairly, and to receive a response if the IRS does not agree with their position.</p>
<h2><strong>V. The Right to Appeal an IRS Decision in an Independent Forum</strong></h2>
<p>Taxpayers are entitled to a fair and impartial administrative appeal of most IRS decisions, including many penalties, and have the right to receive a written response regarding the Office of Appeals’ decision. Taxpayers generally have the right to take their cases to court.</p>
<h2><strong>VI. The Right to Finality</strong></h2>
<p>Taxpayers have the right to know the maximum amount of time they have to challenge the IRS’s position, as well as the maximum amount of time the IRS has to audit a particular tax year or collect a tax debt. Taxpayers have the right to know when the IRS has finished an audit.</p>
<h2><strong>VII. The Right to Privacy <img class="alignright wp-image-3641 " src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/The-Protection-and-Fundamental-Rights-You-Have-with-the-IRS-The-Taxpayer-Bill-of-Rights-sfs-sfstax-jeffrey-schneider-now-what-help-key-padlock.jpg" alt="The Protection and Fundamental Rights You Have with the IRS, The Taxpayer Bill of Rights, sfs, sfstax, jeffrey schneider, now what help, key, padlock" width="590" height="494" /></strong></h2>
<p>Taxpayers have the right to expect that any IRS inquiry, examination, or enforcement action will comply with the law, be no more intrusive than necessary, and will respect all due process rights. This includes search and seizure protections and a collection due process hearing where applicable.</p>
<h2><strong>VIII. The Right to Confidentiality</strong></h2>
<p>Taxpayers have the right to expect that any information that they provide to the IRS will not be disclosed unless authorized by the taxpayer or by law. Taxpayers have the right to expect the IRS to investigate and take appropriate action against its employees, return preparers, and others who wrongfully use or disclose taxpayer return information.</p>
<h2><strong>IX. The Right to Retain Representation</strong></h2>
<p>Taxpayers have the right to retain an authorized representative of their choice to represent them in their dealings with the IRS. Taxpayers have the right to be told that, if they cannot afford to hire a representative, they may be eligible for assistance from a Low-Income Taxpayer Clinic.</p>
<h2><strong>X. The Right to a Fair and Just Tax System</strong></h2>
<p>Taxpayers have the right to expect the tax system to consider facts and circumstances that might affect their underlying liabilities, ability to pay, or ability to provide information in a timely manner. Taxpayers have the right to receive assistance from the Taxpayer Advocate Service if they are experiencing financial difficulty or the IRS has not resolved their tax issues properly and in a timely manner through its normal channels.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>“Not everyone is qualified to be a captain of a ship. When you’re miles from land and things get dicey, you want an Admiral, not a weekend sailor. You need a professional who knows what he or she is doing.”</strong></p>
<p>If your case gets remanded back to appeals, there are two other credentialed professionals that can represent you: the Certified Public Accountant and the Enrolled Agent.</p>
<p>Most tax return preparers provide outstanding service, however, they have differing levels of skill, as well as continuing education requirements and expertise.</p>
<p>Preparers with<strong> unlimited</strong> representation rights can represent their clients on any matters – including audits, payment collection issues, and appeals.</p>
<p>Preparers with<strong> limited</strong> representation rights can only represent clients whose returns they have prepared and signed.</p>
<h2><strong>Credentialed Return Preparers</strong></h2>
<p>Tax return preparers with <strong>unlimited</strong> rights include professionals with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enrolled Agents: Licensed by the IRS. Must pass a three-part Special Enrollment Examination. This is a comprehensive exam that requires them to demonstrate proficiency in federal tax planning, individual and business tax return preparation, and representation.</li>
<li>Attorneys: Licensed by state courts. Attorneys have earned a degree in law and have passed a bar exam. They may offer a range of services, and some specialize in tax preparation and planning.</li>
<li>Certified Public Accountants: Licensed by state courts. CPAs have passed the Uniform CPA Examination. They have completed a study of accounting at a college or university. They may offer a range of services, and some specialize in tax preparation and planning.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><img class="alignright wp-image-3539" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/The-Taxpayer-Representative-woman-sitting-desk-journal-note-taking-now-what-help-sfs-tax.jpg" alt="The Taxpayer Representative, woman, sitting, desk, journal, note taking, now what help, sfs tax" width="517" height="363" /></strong>If you are dealing with an audit, you cannot just walk into any tax return preparers’ office. Only an Enrolled Agent, a CPA, or an attorney can help you with an IRS issue.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>“Ask what those initials mean in the big scheme toward solving your problem. After all, you’ll be on the boat together and entrusting him or her with your financial life. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>You deserve to be certain you have the right one before you turn over the controls.” </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Where to Research for Preparers</strong></h2>
<p>The IRS has a searchable, sortable public directory at <a href="https://irs.treasury.gov/rpo/rpo.jsf">https://irs.treasury.gov/rpo/rpo.jsf</a> to search for various tax preparers.</p>

<p>If you’ve read our <a href="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/how-to-avoid-being-audited/">Top Ten</a> post about avoiding certain red flags, you’re probably aware that some issues are more likely to give rise to an audit than others. Former senior attorney with the Internal Revenue Service Chief Counsel, Laurie Kazenoff, has seen them all.</p>
<p>We took notes. Here are a few:</p>
<h2><strong><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-3515" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IRS-Common-Targets.png" alt="IRS Radar, Common Targets for Audit, chart, tax audits, millionaires, sfs, sfstax" width="680" height="443" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IRS-Common-Targets.png 680w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IRS-Common-Targets-300x195.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IRS-Common-Targets-400x260.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>You can’t completely avoid being audited</li>
<li>There are common targets on the IRS radar</li>
<li>Schedule Cs are a major target</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Schedule Cs: Under a Microscope</strong></h2>
<p>“The higher your income, the more likely you are to be audited, but the most commonly audited areas are Schedule Cs,” said Kazenoff. “[The reason for this is] because of the opportunity to fudge the numbers by understating income or inflating deductions such as home office or other expenses.”</p>
<p>“If the numbers are outside the norm, the computers will pick it up,” Kazenoff cautioned. “Most fields on a return are compared to averages, and outliers will be targeted. Large losses on both individual and business returns will be flagged. If you’re a going concern and have enormous losses, they want to know how you’re supporting yourself, or how you stay in business. If the numbers fall outside the national average, there’s a good chance of being picked up for an examination.”</p>
<h2><strong>Information Missing is a Huge Red Flag </strong></h2>
<p>“Many people don’t realize that the IRS matches every piece of third-party reporting with what taxpayers put on their return,” she said. “This includes interest income, dividend income, independent contractor income as well as W-2 income. The issuer is required to report it both to the taxpayer and the IRS. If the taxpayer fails to report the figures on their return — to the penny — the matching system will flag the return and they will receive a letter from the IRS.”</p>
<h2><strong>Not Every Industry is Considered an Equal Risk</strong></h2>
<h2><img class="alignright wp-image-3516" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/To-W2-or-not-to-W2.jpg" alt="IRS Radar, Common Targets for Audit, employee, independent contractor, 1099, sfs, sfstax" width="450" height="449" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/To-W2-or-not-to-W2.jpg 1200w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/To-W2-or-not-to-W2-150x150.jpg 150w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/To-W2-or-not-to-W2-300x300.jpg 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/To-W2-or-not-to-W2-768x768.jpg 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/To-W2-or-not-to-W2-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/To-W2-or-not-to-W2-570x570.jpg 570w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/To-W2-or-not-to-W2-500x500.jpg 500w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/To-W2-or-not-to-W2-1000x1000.jpg 1000w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/To-W2-or-not-to-W2-700x700.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></h2>
<p>“The service issues a list of industries they target, such as the mining industry,&#8221; she said. “And there are businesses that have historically underreported income. Businesses where cash changes hands, such as restaurants and laundromats, are examples. But although gas stations deal in cash, they have an independent record-keeping system.”</p>
<h2><strong>Are Independent Contractors Frequently Audited? </strong></h2>
<p>The IRS also targets independent contractor situations. Kazenoff noted, “Are the workers really employees?”</p>
<p>Worker misclassification is an important issue for the IRS and various state taxing authorities because of the perception that many employers are not properly classifying their workers. By avoiding labeling their workers as employees, employers can avoid paying payroll taxes, minimum wages, overtime, health and retirement benefits, and paid leave.</p>
<p>“A lot of companies try to avoid payroll taxes, workers compensation and unemployment withholding,” she said. “They think they can get off the hook, but it’s an issue the IRS will pursue.” Although there is no bright-line test to judge whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor, “[The IRS] will look to see if certain factors are present to determine if the worker is really an independent contractor,” she said.</p>
<h2><strong>General Guidelines </strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Employee:</strong> Under common-law rules, anyone who performs services for you is your employee if you can control what will be done and how it will be done. This is so even when you give the employee freedom of action. What matters is that you have the right to control how the services are performed.</li>
<li><strong>Independent Contractor:</strong> The general rule is that an individual is an independent contractor if the payer has the right to control or direct only the result of the work and not what will be done and how it will be done.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Filing a Large Claim for a Refund on an Amended Return</strong></h2>
<p>Filing a large claim for a refund on an amended return will almost always cause an audit, according to Kazenoff. “They will wonder what you did wrong on the first return,” she said. “It will almost always be picked up.”</p>
<p>“If the original return failed to include an item of income, of course, you will want to correct it on an amended return,” she said. “But filing an amended return that claims credits that you didn’t claim on the first return will open up the whole return to scrutiny, so you end up being audited on other things not originally at issue.”</p>
<p>This is particularly true where the amended return raises new issues, she indicated. “As an example, a return might be amended to claim R&amp;D credits that weren’t on the original return. The IRS is likely to audit for that particular issue, but will open up the entire return for questioning,” she said.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Forget 10,000 Leagues Under the Sea. You’ll have to dive much deeper than that to get to the heart of the IRS.</strong></h2>
<p>When it comes to the administration and enforcement of our tax system, there are four basic levels:</p>
<h2><strong><img class="wp-image-3636 size-full alignright" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Chapter-Meme-B-1.jpg" alt="" width="526" height="526" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Chapter-Meme-B-1.jpg 526w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Chapter-Meme-B-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Chapter-Meme-B-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Chapter-Meme-B-1-500x500.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px" /></strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Examinations (Audits)</li>
<li>Collections</li>
<li>Appeals</li>
<li>Criminal Investigations</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s time to talk about the first three.</p>
<h2><strong>Examinations (Audits) </strong></h2>
<p>When a return is filed and processed, it is automatically deemed correct unless the IRS computers find an error.</p>
<h3><strong>What types of errors are picked up by the computers?</strong></h3>
<p>If you understate the income reported, overreport expenses, or report you had health insurance when you did not, the computer spits out a notice showing what they have compared to what you’ve put on your return.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you’ll get selected for audit (done locally or by mail). The auditor can pick up on these same errors or omissions.</p>
<h2><strong>Collections</strong></h2>
<p>The Internal Revenue Service is the world’s largest and most aggressive collection agency. Even with their funding woes, they can and will come after you (either in person or by mail <a href="https://sfstaxacct.com/2019/04/2019-dirty-dozen-list-of-tax-scams/">– never a phone call or email.</a>)</p>
<h2><strong><img class="alignright wp-image-3638 " src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/You-Have-It-We-Want-It-sfs-now-what-help-courtroom-courthouse-outside-2.jpg" alt="" width="427" height="645" /></strong></h2>
<p>One of the IRS collection units is the Automated Collections Service, or ACS. They have various service centers around the country. Then, there are Settlement Officers. These officials are usually in the IRS Appeals Office.</p>
<h2><strong>Appeals </strong></h2>
<p>A taxpayer usually gets one shot at appeals. The next step is to prepare and file a tax court petition. Generally, you can file this once you receive a 90-day notice (Statutory Notice of Deficiency.) You can prepare the petition:</p>
<ul>
<li>yourself</li>
<li>by a U.S. Tax Court Practitioner</li>
<li>by an attorney licensed to practice in your state</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, there is a $60 fee. You will wait until your petition gets on the court docket. Then, it is assigned to an IRS lawyer. Most of the time, IRS attorneys will “send it back to appeals,” because most cases are not USTC worthy (i.e. not enough money).</p>
<p>If you do not want to go to court (it is not cheap unless you do it yourself, and that is not highly recommended) and you cannot/do not pay, that is the crux of this book.</p>
<p>Just as you have the right to appeal an IRS decision, you also have the right to be represented.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">The Role of the Taxpayer, the Tax Representative, and the IRS</h1>
<p>When you are dancing, only one person can lead. In a symphony, only trumpets can play the trumpet part. And when you’re watching a movie, the lead character can’t take on all of the supporting roles as well. It’s the same with you, the IRS and your tax representative.</p>
<p>Of course, you can try to handle it all yourself with the IRS.</p>
<p>The problem is that you aren’t trained on all of the tax laws. You aren’t familiar with the ways the IRS works. You haven’t been down this road before.</p>
<p>But a tax representative has!</p>
<h2>The Role of the Taxpayer, the Tax Representative, and the IRS: Why You Need Help<img class="size-medium wp-image-1042 alignright" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Chapter-3-Blog-Second-Photo-300x200.jpg" alt="The Role of the Taxpayer, The Tax Representative, and the IRS, SFS Tax Problem Solutions" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Chapter-3-Blog-Second-Photo-300x200.jpg 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Chapter-3-Blog-Second-Photo-700x466.jpg 700w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Chapter-3-Blog-Second-Photo.jpg 767w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></h2>
<p>A friend of mine was in a serious car accident. Right from the start, the insurance company was trying to close the case. They were telling him what his car and medical bills would be before he even knew.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long for him to realize he needed a representative to help him.</p>
<p>In this case – personal injury – the right person for the job was an attorney.</p>
<p>When it comes to dealing with the IRS, the right person for the job is an EA or other trained professional.</p>
<h2>The Role of the Taxpayer, the Tax Representative, and the IRS: An EA is the One for the Job</h2>
<p>EA stands for Enrolled Agent. Enrolled Agents are the only tax practitioners authorized by the Federal government who have technical expertise in the field of taxation. They are the only ones empowered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury to represent taxpayers before all levels of the Internal Revenue Service.</p>
<p>Enrolled Agent status is the highest credential the IRS awards.</p>
<p>In other words, an EA knows how the IRS works. The IRS themselves has said so!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Debt can be a dark cloud that hangs over everything you do. When it comes to taxes, it’s that much worse. The more you ignore a tax debt, the bigger the debt gets, as penalties and interest are added on. Not only that, the IRS has the power to assess <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_lien">tax liens</a> against your personal property and even levy your bank account or garnish your wages.</p>
<p>If this is you… take heart!</p>
<h3><strong>You Can Make a Fresh Start </strong></h3>
<p>The IRS has a Fresh Start program that launched 10 years ago in the midst of a biting economic recession. Designed to make paying your back taxes and avoiding tax liens easier, it has been expanded over the years. The program has helped people around the country get back on their feet.</p>
<p>Knowing exactly where you stand makes it easier to come to a resolution that will satisfy the IRS and allow you to move on with your life…minus one dark cloud. We recommend retaining a professional in dealing with these issues.</p>
<h3><strong>Greater Access to Installment Agreements </strong></h3>
<p>Sometimes you can’t pay what you owe all at once. The IRS offers installment agreements for this purpose.</p>
<p>What if you can’t pay the monthly amount the IRS wants?</p>
<p>Don’t despair.</p>
<p>There are options.</p>
<h3><strong>IRS Tax Liens Minimum Raised</strong></h3>
<p>The program increased to $10,000 the amount you must owe before a tax lien can be filed. The IRS may still file a tax lien notice for an amount less than the $10,000 at its discretion, however.</p>
<p>One important feature of the Fresh Start program is that the tax lien may be withdrawn if you meet certain conditions, including paying off your tax debt.  You may also qualify if you are paying your debt through a Direct Debit installment agreement.</p>
<p>However, if you then default on your installment agreement the IRS can file another tax lien.</p>
<h3><strong>Greater Flexibility when Considering Offers in Compromise</strong></h3>
<p>The IRS will analyze your ability to pay when considering whether to agree to allow you to settle your tax debt for less than the full amount. The Fresh Start program gave the IRS more flexibility when analyzing that ability.</p>
<p>If they believe you can pay in full within a reasonable amount of time, it will probably not be accepted. The IRS looks at your income, assets, and other factors in determining your ability to pay.</p>
<p>Did we make it sound easy? It’s not. It’s a lot of work and it takes time for the taxpayer and their representative. Don’t do this alone.</p>
<p>Whatever your tax situation may be, we can help. We have 35 years of experience helping people just like you deal with the IRS.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You’ve probably heard someone who represents himself has a fool for a client. This is just as true when it comes to the IRS as it is in a criminal court.</p>
<p>If you’re in trouble with the IRS, you need an Enrolled Agent. Here’s why:</p>
<h2><strong>Enrolled Agent is the Highest Credential Issued by the IRS</strong></h2>
<p>Enrolled agents are the only federally licensed tax practitioners who specialize in taxation and can represent clients before all levels of the IRS.</p>
<p>They can also represent taxpayers – businesses or individuals – in any state and in any tax matter.</p>
<p>The Enrolled Agent (EA) is the most expansive license the IRS grants.</p>
<p>There’s no substitute for an EA!</p>

Here's What You Need" width="477" height="318" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cable-call-communication-33999-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cable-call-communication-33999-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cable-call-communication-33999-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cable-call-communication-33999-1-700x467.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 477px) 100vw, 477px" />Enrolled Agents have the Expertise You Need</strong></h3>
<p>EAs face stringent qualifications to earn their designation.</p>
<p>Candidates must pass a rigorous background check, conducted by the IRS.</p>
<p>They have to either have been employed by the IRS for five years or pass the SEE (Special Enrollment Exam). This three-part, comprehensive tax code test is administered by the <a href="https://www.naea.org/">National Association of Enrolled Agents (NAEA)</a>. It covers individual and business tax returns, tax representation and practice and procedure.</p>
<p>Enrolled agents have gone beyond the basic tax preparer requirements. They have demonstrated expertise in the field of taxes.</p>
<h3><strong>Enrolled Agents Stay Current on the Ever-Changing Tax Laws</strong></h3>
<p>EAs must also complete 72 hours of education courses every three years.</p>
<p>Members of the NAEA face an even higher standard. They must complete 90 hours each three year period.</p>
<p>Attorneys and CPAs may or may not specialize in taxation. All Enrolled Agents do.</p>
<p>EAs eat, breathe and live taxes!</p>
<h3><strong>Enrolled Agents who are Members of the NAEA adhere to a Code of Ethics</strong></h3>
<p>NAEA members must adhere to a stringent Code of Ethics and Rules of Professional Conduct. They belong to a strong network of experienced, well-trained tax professionals, effectively representing their clients and working to make the tax code fair and reasonably enforced.</p>
<h3><strong>Help When You Need It</strong></h3>
<p>No matter what your tax problem is, SFS can help. Jeff Schneider is an Enrolled Agent, Certified Tax Resolution Specialist, and NTPI Fellow. He is also a member of the NAEA with over 35 years of experience resolving tax issues with the IRS.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, our clients never have to meet or speak to the IRS. We step into your shoes, and you will be able to live your life and breathe again. Remember, we got your back… taxes!</p>
