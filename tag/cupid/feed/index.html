			<h4><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> Valentine&#8217;s Day </strong></span></h4>
<p>Chocolates, flowers, cupid, and hearts are all associated with Valentine&#8217;s Day. According to the National Retail Federation, Americans now spend more than $20 billion lavishing gifts on their kids, friends, and significant others.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Who decided a day in the middle of February is a time to celebrate love and spend a bunch of money on gifts? The actual story of how Valentine&#8217;s Day (and its symbols) got its wings, and how much Americans spend on gifts for Valentine&#8217;s Day, might surprise you.</span></p>
<h4><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It&#8217;s named after a Catholic saint (perhaps).</span></strong></h4>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> There are stories of three different Catholic saints named Valentine, who was involved in various romantic shenanigans. The tales include conducting outlawed marriages, a secret relationship with a jailer&#8217;s daughter, and a love letter ending in &#8220;from your Valentine.&#8221; Unfortunately, all three saints met a similar fate by being put to death by Caesar. How romantic! While it&#8217;s pretty clear Valentine&#8217;s Day derives from one of these three saints, no one knows which one for sure. </span></p>
<h4><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It may have started as a <a href="https://www.learnreligions.com/valentines-day-pagan-celebrations-2562121">Pagan celebration</a>.</span></strong></h4>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Ancient Pagan festivals were often very unusual, and this one is no exception. Historians believe it involved goat and dog sacrifices, using their blood-stained animal hides, and having a drawing for a companion for the next year. It&#8217;s safe to say that everyone, especially your dog, is relieved this tradition fizzled out at some point. </span></p>
<h4><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Its primary color, red, has scientific backing.</span></strong></h4>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Giving flowers, especially red roses, is a popular romantic gesture all the way back to the Saint Valentine era. Why red? It represents passion and desire. According to a study by the University of Rochester, science ties color to behavior. The study demonstrates that men find women wearing red attire more attractive. </span></p>
<h4><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Americans spend an average of $162 on gifts.</span></strong></h4>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While the percentage of Americans who celebrate Valentine&#8217;s Day has declined over the past decade (63% of Americans celebrated the holiday in 2009 compared to 51% in 2019), those who do celebrate Valentine&#8217;s Day spent an average of $162 on gifts in 2019 compared to $103 in 2009.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Knowing the history of this holiday and how much money the average consumer spends on gifts for this special day adds context to the holiday. However, recreating the actual events is probably not a great idea. Instead, give your loved ones a hug, and a treat.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Have a wonderful Day!</span></p>
