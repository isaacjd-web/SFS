								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you owe back taxes the IRS can make your life miserable. Have you received a Notice from the IRS only to leave it on your kitchen counter, desk, or worse, hide it under a stack of bills? Unfortunately, those letters from the IRS will just keep coming. Your problem won’t go away on its own.</p>
<p>If you don’t take action now, the IRS WILL keep piling on penalties and interest…and interest on top of the penalties&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-782" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/IRS-enve-305x172-300x169.jpg" alt="If-you-owe-back-taxes-the-IRS-can-make-your-life-miserable-irs-envelope" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/IRS-enve-305x172-300x169.jpg 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/IRS-enve-305x172.jpg 305w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The IRS doesn’t like being ignored, so this is how they get your attention. They want to be sure you know they are not going away. It’s like they haunt you with their ongoing letters. If you don’t respond to them the penalties they tack on is like a club they keep hitting you over the head with. Penalties are just the beginning of what they can do to your life.</p>
<h4>But that’s just the beginning.</h4>
<p>The IRS has a lot of power over your life. They not only can freeze your bank accounts—that’s right—but they can seize all the money in your bank accounts as well.</p>
<p>The agency can garnish your wages and<em> can legally take as much as 90% of your net paycheck.</em> Can you live on 10% of your net pay? The IRS thinks and expects you can!</p>
<p>Besides slapping Bank Levies and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garnishment#Wages">Wage Garnishments</a> on you, they can put a lien on your house, making it nearly impossible to borrow against it to pay the IRS off. And if you sell your house, the IRS gets their money first from any equity left over.</p>
<p>If you owe back taxes the IRS can make your life miserable.  Federal Tax Liens prevent you from borrowing any money—except for those high-charging money stores located in mini-malls. An IRS lien makes it harder to rent an apartment, get a car, obtain any kind of credit; An IRS Lien can even jeopardize your job!</p>
<p>And believe it or not, the IRS has the authority to show up and knock on your door! Make no mistake—the IRS is the most brutal collection agency on the planet.</p>
