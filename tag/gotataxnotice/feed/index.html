								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><em>You Got a Tax Notice. You Cannot Run or Hide, So Now What? What to Do When the IRS Wants Something from You. An SFS Tax Problem Solutions Blog.</em></p>
<p>So you got a tax notice. Plan your next move very, very carefully. It’s like playing a game of chess.</p>
<p>However, you have to actually play.</p>
<h3><strong>Got a Tax Notice? Open It!</strong></h3>
<p>We’ve covered this before, but it bears repeating: The absolute worst thing you can do is to do nothing.</p>
<p>The first notice the IRS sends is the opening call. They are asking for you to take an action or to provide more information… and they expect a response. If you don’t give them one, they will escalate to the next level.</p>
<p>Eventually, you can be hit with a huge tax bill including interest and penalties. You can get a lien placed on your social security number, attaching to all of your property. You can have your wages levied. You can even be hauled into tax court and hit with a jail sentence. Don’t let any of this happen to you!</p>
<p>All of these negative outcomes are preventable. As long as you take the first step by opening the notice.</p>

<h3><strong>Got a Tax Notice? Seek Professional Help</strong></h3>
<p>It is advisable to get an Enrolled Agent to assist you with the handling this notice. As America’s Tax Expert,® an Enrolled Agent (EA) has been down this road many times. He or she can assess your situation and work toward the best possible outcome.</p>
<h3><strong>Got a Tax Notice? Proceed with Caution</strong></h3>
<p>Choosing to handle your own IRS problems can leave you vulnerable to many pitfalls.</p>
<p>“As previously mentioned, a tax professional will be able to guide you through this process and place you in the best possible light. But, if you want to handle it yourself, it is best to give the IRS exactly what they ask, nothing more,” advised Jeffrey Schneider, EA, CTRS, NTPI Fellow in his book, <em>Now What? I Got a Tax Notice from the IRS. Help! </em></p>
<p>Well-meaning folks can cost themselves thousands of dollars by revealing too much.</p>
<p>And that’s just one potential problem that can arise if you choose to go it alone.</p>
<h3><strong>Got a Tax Notice? There are Options Available to You</strong></h3>
<p>Let’s say you legitimately owe the IRS money… and you legitimately can’t pay it. There are ways to mitigate your tax debt or to manage it so that you can still live your life while dealing with it.</p>
<p>An EA can analyze past tax years to see if you were due a refund (or a bigger refund) that can offset your debt. Or, he or she can help you apply for an Installment Agreement or an Offer in Compromise.</p>
<p>And all is not lost if the IRS has already put a tax lien or levy on your property or wages. An EA can get you back into good standing with the IRS.</p>
<p>It’s definitely not as bad as it may seem when that tax notice first shows up in the mailbox!</p>
<p>Yes, there is hope… no matter what your situation is.</p>
