<p>Snipes continues to getting knocked down by the IRS. Rather than give up, he too keeps getting back in the ring. In his latest skirmish with the service, the Tax Court held that the IRS did not abuse its discretion by refusing to accept his offer in compromise.</p>
<p>Snipes’ problems began with federal tax liabilities of $23.5 million from 2001-2006. This was partially a result of his failure to file tax returns. The IRS assessed those liabilities, and filed a notice of federal tax lien. It then issued a notice and demand for payment of the liabilities.</p>

<p>Wesley Snipes must know a little how Carmen Basilio felt.</p>
<p>Basilio, the “Upstate Onion Farmer” from Canastota, N.Y., was a world champion boxer in both the Welterweight and Middleweight divisions during the 1950s. Unfortunately, he was knocked down repeatedly in one match that he was sure to lose. When asked afterward why he kept getting up despite having no chance, he reportedly said “I don’t want to start any bad habits.”</p>
<p>Snipes continues to getting knocked down by the IRS. Rather than give up, he too keeps getting back in the ring. In his latest skirmish with the service, the Tax Court held that the IRS did not abuse its discretion by refusing to accept his offer in compromise.</p>
<p>Snipes’ problems began with federal tax liabilities of $23.5 million from 2001-2006. This was partially a result of his failure to file tax returns. The IRS assessed those liabilities, and filed a notice of federal tax lien. It then issued a notice and demand for payment of the liabilities. <img class="alignright wp-image-2540" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Wesley-Snipes-Continuously-Fights-the-IRS-carmen-basilio-fighting-getting-medical-assistance.jpg" alt="Wesley Snipes Continuously Fights the IRS, carmen, basilio, fighting, getting medical assistance" width="485" height="281" /></p>
<h3><strong>The Proceedings</strong></h3>
<p>When Snipes did not pay, the IRS issued a notice of the filing. Snipes requested a collection due process hearing and stated that he wanted a collection alternative – an offer in compromise or “currently not collectible” status – and wanted the notice of federal tax lien withdrawn.</p>
<p>Snipes did not challenge his underlying tax liabilities. He made a cash offer of $842,061, less than 4 percent of the total underlying liability. The IRS issued a notice of determination rejecting his OIC and sustaining the notice of federal tax lien. Snipes filed a petition with the Tax Court.</p>
<p>Snipes contended during both CDP proceedings that his financial adviser, W. Johnson, had taken out loans and disposed of assets and income on his behalf, diverting the funds without his knowledge or benefit. He provided affidavits from Johnson of his misconduct and misuse of his assets and income, but did not provide any definitive documentation showing the dissipation or diversion of his assets or income.</p>
<p>Snipes requested that the IRS conduct a transferee investigation of Johnson, and that they accept his offer with the condition of proving Johnson’s transferee liability. The settlement officer requested permission from her manager to conduct an expedited transferee investigation, but the manager explained that the CDP hearing could not be held open for a transferee investigation, nor could the IRS accept an OIC with conditions imposed on it.</p>
<h3><strong>One of Many Verdicts</strong></h3>
<p>Following a review of Snipe’s case, the settlement officer an effort to compromise for settlement purposes. She reduced Snipes’ “reasonable collection potential” to $9,581,027. Snipes maintained his original OIC of $842,061. The settlement officer concluded that it was not in the best interest of the government to accept the OIC. She issued Snipes a supplemental notice sustaining the notice of federal tax lien, and again rejecting Snipes’ OIC.</p>
<p>The Tax Court noted that the validity of Snipes’ underlying tax liabilities was not at issue. The court concluded that the settlement officer properly based her determination on the required factors. They determined that she did not abuse her discretion in determining that acceptance of the OIC was not in the best interests of the United States.</p>
<p>The Tax Court held that in light of Snipes’ failure to provide bona fide documentation to prove his assets and financial condition, as well as the disparity in his offer versus his RCP as determined by the IRS, the settlement officer did not abuse her discretion in her rejection of Snipes’ offer, refusing to conduct an expedited transferee investigation, or sustaining the filing of the notice. <img class="alignright wp-image-2541" title="Wesley Snipes Continuously Fights the IRS, on tv" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Wesley-Snipes-Continuously-Fights-the-IRS-on-tv.jpg" alt="Wesley Snipes Continuously Fights the IRS, on tv" width="564" height="411" /></p>
<p>“The court was unable to determine whether or not he still owned the property. On a smaller scale, this is what happens all the time,” Davidoff noted. “And it’s not the end of the line for him.</p>
<h3><strong>What Happens Next: The Cycle</strong></h3>
<p>Now it will go back to Collections, and start all over again. In the meantime he has delayed the IRS, and the statute of limitations has been extended for five years. My guess is that he’s paid more than $100,000 to do this, but he has all the rights that any other taxpayer has in Collections. If they think some of his assets got transferred to Johnson, they might try to seize some of those assets.”</p>
<p>“It sounds like he has a lot of illiquid assets or assets that he can’t account for. If he’s correct in the valuation of his assets, then that’s all they can take – they can’t take more than he has,” Davidoff mentioned.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #000000;">There are many things people rarely think of when they walk down the aisle. Marrying into another person’s tax debt can be one of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">You marry for better or worse, richer or poorer… tax debt or not, whether you are aware of it (or not).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">It is arguably worse when, after the honeymoon is long-over, your trusted spouse wracks up tax debt you know nothing about.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In these situations, there is a remedy.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The IRS has a provision for innocent spouse relief.</span></p>
<h3><strong><img class=" wp-image-1347 alignright" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Im-Innocent-I-Tell-You-I-Didnt-Do-It-Having-a-Tax-Debt-that-Isnt-Yours-SFS-Tax-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Marriage-Tux-Dress-Shoes-Wedding-Gown-Grass-300x201.png" alt="Im Innocent, I Tell You, I Didnt Do It, Having a Tax Debt that Isnt Yours, SFS Tax, SFS Tax Problem Solutions, Marriage, Tux, Dress Shoes, Wedding Gown, Grass" width="364" height="244" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Im-Innocent-I-Tell-You-I-Didnt-Do-It-Having-a-Tax-Debt-that-Isnt-Yours-SFS-Tax-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Marriage-Tux-Dress-Shoes-Wedding-Gown-Grass-300x201.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Im-Innocent-I-Tell-You-I-Didnt-Do-It-Having-a-Tax-Debt-that-Isnt-Yours-SFS-Tax-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Marriage-Tux-Dress-Shoes-Wedding-Gown-Grass-700x468.png 700w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Im-Innocent-I-Tell-You-I-Didnt-Do-It-Having-a-Tax-Debt-that-Isnt-Yours-SFS-Tax-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Marriage-Tux-Dress-Shoes-Wedding-Gown-Grass.png 763w" sizes="(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px" />What You Need to Know about Claiming Innocent Spouse</strong></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This is not an easy path, by any means.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Among other requirements, the IRS wants you to prove you could have no knowledge that the money flowing into the household was much greater in proportion to what you claimed your tax debt was.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">For example, let’s say you have a 4,000-square-foot home on the water with a low mortgage balance, a yacht, and two paid-for luxury cars, but your tax debt is near zero. In this case, you’d have a hard time selling ignorance.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">It’s true that some spouses wholeheartedly trust that the other spouse is handling finances correctly. Sometimes those spouses will simply sign whatever is put in front of them.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Don’t be One of those Spouses</strong></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">What’s at risk if you don’t stay plugged into what is going on in your household?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Your money, your well-being and your future status with the IRS </span>is<span style="color: #000000;"> on the line.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">After all, you can divorce your spouse. You may not be able to so easily divorce your tax debt. Therefore, you need to do your best to understand what you are getting into.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Take your tax return to an experienced Enrolled Agent to look it over for you, or better yet, have him or her prepare one.</span></p>
<h3>Fraud &amp; Substitute for Return</h3>
<p>There are other ways to get attached to a tax debt that isn&#8217;t yours (or you think isn&#8217;t yours).</p>
<p>Although the IRS continues to fight it, identity theft still exists. That&#8217;s why you need to monitor what comes to you from the IRS closely. For example, don&#8217;t cash a refund check unless you filed a return claiming that exact refund.</p>
<p>Then, there are times you may get an IRS notice stating that you owe tax, interest, and penalties from an old return &#8211; even one from 15 years ago (or more).</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&#8220;You are shocked, as you do not remember filing a return way back then. Other than identity theft, a return may also have been prepared for you. Who would do that? The IRS, that&#8217;s who,&#8221; said Jeffrey Schneider in his book <a href="http://amazon.com/What-Notice-IRS-Help-Life-preserving-ebook/dp/B079XWL8P9"><em>Now What? I Got a Tax Notice from the IRS. Help! </em></a></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Substitute for Return is what the IRS can prepare for you in the event you do not file your taxes. Based on the information they have received about you from employers, financial institutions, and clients, the IRS compiles a tax return for you. If you owe tax, you will receive a notice in the mail that lets you know you owe the tax, plus penalties and interest.</p>
<p>Incidentally, if it is a 15-year-old return, that would be a lot of interest as well as a penalty of up to 25% of the tax due (and perhaps one for failure to file as well).</p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">Enrolled Agents are held to the highest ethical standards, both personally on their own returns as well as professionally with their clients’. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">They will question and dig into anything they find that is outside the bounds of the law. They will also ensure that each spouse is aware of the situation they are in, and can help with identity theft as well as Substitute for Returns. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">No matter what the issue is, a visit to an EA can put you well on the road to fixing your tax issues.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Debt can be a dark cloud that hangs over everything you do. When it comes to taxes, it’s that much worse. The more you ignore a tax debt, the bigger the debt gets, as penalties and interest are added on. Not only that, the IRS has the power to assess <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_lien">tax liens</a> against your personal property and even levy your bank account or garnish your wages.</p>
<p>If this is you… take heart!</p>
<h3><strong>You Can Make a Fresh Start </strong></h3>
<p>The IRS has a Fresh Start program that launched 10 years ago in the midst of a biting economic recession. Designed to make paying your back taxes and avoiding tax liens easier, it has been expanded over the years. The program has helped people around the country get back on their feet.</p>
<p>Knowing exactly where you stand makes it easier to come to a resolution that will satisfy the IRS and allow you to move on with your life…minus one dark cloud. We recommend retaining a professional in dealing with these issues.</p>
<h3><strong>Greater Access to Installment Agreements </strong></h3>
<p>Sometimes you can’t pay what you owe all at once. The IRS offers installment agreements for this purpose.</p>
<p>What if you can’t pay the monthly amount the IRS wants?</p>
<p>Don’t despair.</p>
<p>There are options.</p>
<h3><strong>IRS Tax Liens Minimum Raised</strong></h3>
<p>The program increased to $10,000 the amount you must owe before a tax lien can be filed. The IRS may still file a tax lien notice for an amount less than the $10,000 at its discretion, however.</p>
<p>One important feature of the Fresh Start program is that the tax lien may be withdrawn if you meet certain conditions, including paying off your tax debt.  You may also qualify if you are paying your debt through a Direct Debit installment agreement.</p>
<p>However, if you then default on your installment agreement the IRS can file another tax lien.</p>
<h3><strong>Greater Flexibility when Considering Offers in Compromise</strong></h3>
<p>The IRS will analyze your ability to pay when considering whether to agree to allow you to settle your tax debt for less than the full amount. The Fresh Start program gave the IRS more flexibility when analyzing that ability.</p>
<p>If they believe you can pay in full within a reasonable amount of time, it will probably not be accepted. The IRS looks at your income, assets, and other factors in determining your ability to pay.</p>
<p>Did we make it sound easy? It’s not. It’s a lot of work and it takes time for the taxpayer and their representative. Don’t do this alone.</p>
