<p>Have you made your resolutions for 2019? As a businessowner, resolutions can be very different from the typical goals individuals set for themselves. If you’re unsure of what exactly the best course of action for 2019 is for your business or need help figuring out how to do it, we’ve listed a ton of options to help you out.</p>
<h2>Resolution 1: Enhance Your Customers’ Experience</h2>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-3686 " src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Resolutions-for-Small-Businesses-in-2019-calculator-pen-papers-desk-woman-invoices-1.jpg" alt="" width="426" height="410" /></p>
<p>Let’s face it – if you’ve been in business for even a short bit of time, you’ve probably had at least one unsatisfied client/customer. We’ve all been there. Minimizing the potential for things to go wrong will help maximize each individual’s experience with your small business. You can:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Offer a complimentary phone consultation.</strong> This allows new clients/customers to get to know you and your business better. After all – as a small business – they are usually investing in YOU. Relationship-building is key to maintaining your customers’ overall experience. The consumer will be greatly impacted by recognizing that you have taken a genuine interest in improving his/her life somehow.</li>
<li><strong>Fix problems before they happen. </strong>Staying one step ahead of your clients/customers will help to create that seamless customer experience your small business needs. Ensure you’re answering <strong>all </strong>phone calls, or make sure somebody is. Don’t take on a bigger workload than you can handle – if it’s stressing you out, it’s stressing them out too.</li>
<li><strong>Stand out. </strong>Send your customers cards! With the onset of the internet, social media, and emails creating fast and simple means of communication, paper correspondence has been dying off. It’s a small but effective way to stand out to those your small business has a relationship with.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Resolution 2: Straighten Up Your Technology</h2>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-3687 " src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Resolutions-for-Small-Businesses-in-2019-closet-picking-out-brown-shirt-hand-expand-your-potential-1.jpg" alt="" width="503" height="326" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Back up your data.</strong> Have you ever had a hard drive crash? We have, too. Backing up data can easily slip the mind, especially with auto-backup programs. Hard drives break or die eventually, so make sure you make a copy of your files either on a secure, encrypted cloud service or on another backup disk that you store somewhere safe. Do this at least once a month.</li>
<li><strong>Get organized.</strong> As a small businessowner, you’re either working alone or maybe with a few other employees. If your data is stored on a computer, sometimes we place files in the wrong folders, or get lazy and not name them properly. Sorting your items properly will help to ensure your success.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Resolution 3: Ensure Business Growth and Development – Consistently</h2>
<p>Successful businesses are constantly adapting. If you’re not making time to learn new things, you’re limiting yourself and your businesses’ potential.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Set aside time each week for an “assess and progress” meeting with your employees. </strong>Most successful businesses will set aside time on Fridays or even Mondays to see analyze what’s going on and brainstorm new ideas. It creates a positive way to begin or end each week and allows for business development.</li>
<li><strong>Take courses.</strong> Conferences, online courses, volunteering, and training keep your mind fresh and active. You’ll be able to expand your thinking – and your clients will notice your efforts.</li>
<li><strong>Define goals.</strong> Set <a href="https://smallbusiness.chron.com/examples-long--short-term-goals-business-4551.html">short-term</a> and <a href="https://smallbusiness.chron.com/examples-long--short-term-goals-business-4551.html">long-term</a> goals for your company. Create plans of action to achieve those goals, and set aside time each week to reflect upon how your steps to achieve those goals are working and the benefits they’re bringing you.<br />
<h2><strong><img class="alignright wp-image-3688 " src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Resolutions-for-Small-Businesses-in-2019-employees-explaining-meeting-1.jpg" alt="" width="519" height="352" /></strong></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Resolution 4: Hire More Help</h2>
<p>I know, I know. It takes time to train employees. <a href="https://smallbusiness.chron.com/advantages-disadvantages-hiring-employee-18966.html">Hiring others</a> costs your company money up-front, but the long-term profits will benefit your business while taking the stress of time-consuming projects off of your back.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Product/Business Manager. </strong>You’ll need somebody who knows your business well enough to keep you on track. Having a manager who understands the value in your product(s) is necessary so you can relinquish some control and focus on bigger things.</li>
<li><strong>Sales Representative.</strong> Once a business knows exactly what it’s offering, you’ll need someone that knows how to target new customers and tell them why a particular product or service matters to them. An experienced salesperson knows how to provide value and fine-tune responses to any and all challenges or questions a doubtful potential new client may have.</li>
<li>Let’s face it – with tax laws constantly changing and numbers fluctuating, it’s nearly impossible to take care of your growing businesses’ finances by yourself. Having an Enrolled Agent managing your financial data is crucial for any business. As your success flourishes, the potential for an audit increases, and your Enrolled Agent will suddenly become your best friend.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Stay Focused</h2>
<p>Refer back to this list every month or so to keep track of your resolutions, remotivate you, and help your small business stay on a positive track in 2019.
