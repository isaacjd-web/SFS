Here’s What to Do.</strong></h1>
<p>The IRS takes unpaid payroll taxes seriously. These are some of the worst kind of back taxes you can owe. If you’re a small business owner with payroll tax problems, read on to learn what you can do to avoid the IRS crippling your business or worse, shut your business down completely.</p>
<p>And why would they do this? When you withhold taxes from employees’ checks, it is not yours. Not paying taxes is considered stealing.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-3674 " src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Small-Business-Owner-Owe-Payroll-Taxes-Here’s-What-to-Do-stressed-man-pay-phone-calling-making-phone-call-1.jpg" alt="Small Business Owner, Owe Payroll Taxes, Here’s What to Do, stressed, man, pay phone, calling, making phone call" width="510" height="497" /></p>
<h2><strong>Why Small Business Owners Get Into Payroll Tax Trouble In The First Place</strong></h2>
<p>It’s hard being a small business owner today, trying to pay your employees their paychecks every week, and pay the IRS all those payroll taxes.</p>
<p>A lot of times when money is short, you pay the employees first. You need to be able to take care of them even if it means not paying yourself.  If nothing else, the process of having to find new employees is a pain – don’t make them quit on you!</p>
<p>It can seem easy to “just pay it next pay period” and give yourself a little cash flow cushion, but skipping paying your employees payroll tax deposits is never a good idea.</p>
<p>What happens too often is one pay period turns into 2, and 3, and 4, and eventually you’re so deep in payroll tax debt that the only thing you want to do is completely ignore your problem.</p>
<p>The IRS doesn’t care if you can’t pay your employees.  They don’t care if they put your employees out on the street. It just doesn’t matter if you can’t collect your receivables.  They don’t care if one of your largest and best customers just went “belly-up”. You have money that belongs to them and they will do whatever they have to. They’ll put you out of business to collect it. They don’t care who you are or what business you are in.</p>
<h2><strong>Penalties are The Kiss Of Death When It Comes to Back Payroll Taxes</strong></h2>
<p>Penalties for failing to file and pay your payroll taxes are the “kiss of death” for any small business owner. They tack on penalties totaling 33% in just the first 16 days! And it doesn’t stop there.  The IRS adds interest on top of the penalties too. It is not uncommon that a payroll tax liability doubles in short order. And if you don’t pay them or work something out, they will shut you down. Why would a Revenue Officer want to work out an arrangement with you when shutting your business down is much less work?</p>
<h2><strong><img class="wp-image-3164 aligncenter" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Small-Business-Owner-Owe-Payroll-Taxes-Here’s-What-To-Do-chart-federal-tax-deposit-penalties.jpg" alt="Small Business Owner Owe Payroll Taxes Here’s What To Do, chart, federal tax deposit penalties" width="828" height="242" /></strong></h2>
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>The IRS Will Collect or They Will Shut You Down</strong></h2>
<p>It’s as simple as that.  The IRS is the most brutal collection agency on the planet.  They have more authority than the President of the United States. Therefore, they have all the ways and means to do whatever it takes to collect what’s owed to them. Even though you certainly didn’t expect to be short in funds, you weren’t avoiding payroll taxes because you didn’t want to. The money simply wasn’t there.  It’s not your fault.  One week you’re short of cash.  It was a slow week, a customer’s check bounced, or any number of legitimate reasons that just prevent you from paying the IRS.  The next week comes and goes, and you realize you still don’t have enough money to make that payroll tax deposit.  And then the entire situation starts “snow-balling” into an avalanche.</p>
<h2><strong>Should You Call The IRS To Get Your Payroll Issue Fixed? <img class="alignright wp-image-3675 " src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Small-Business-Owner-Owe-Payroll-Taxes-Here’s-What-to-Do-stress-colored-pencil-writing-red-1.jpg" alt="Small Business Owner, Owe Payroll Taxes, Here’s What to Do, stress, colored pencil, writing, red" width="488" height="362" /></strong></h2>
<p>If you were to call the IRS, and were able to get through after waiting on “hold” for an hour or more, and try to explain your situation—you might as well have a conversation with the wall—because they don’t care.  The IRS representative that you’re talking to probably makes less than $20 an hour, isn’t properly equipped to handle too many issues.  These representatives have probably never made a payroll in their life. Do you think they know what it’s like running a small business? Do you really think they will have any sympathy for you?</p>
<p>Not only is the answer “NO” but they can also dictate the fate of your case. What they will try to get, while you’re on the phone, is all your personal and financial information.  They want to know where you bank; they’ll want to know all about your customers who owe you money, they’ll want to know about the value of all your assets, like your home, cars, motorcycles, etc. Why? Because now they have all the information they need to levy your bank accounts, take your receivables and seize your property.</p>
<p>Plus, customer service is a misnomer. You are not their customer, the government is!</p>
<p>Now that you know you shouldn’t be talking to the IRS because they are not going to help you, you might be wondering what you should do?  Where should you turn for help?  They smartest thing you can do to protect your business and family is to have someone represent you—someone who deals with the IRS for a living. You need to get help from an experienced tax expert. An Enrolled Agent deals with the IRS every day, helping small business owners keep their businesses and settle IRS payroll tax problems.</p>
<h2><strong>Find a Resolution</strong></h2>
<p>Jeffrey Schneider EA, CTRS, NTPIF, ACT-E steps into your shoes and protects you from the IRS’s abusive tactics. He takes over all communications from the IRS on your behalf. Once they realize you have someone on your side protecting you, who knows their tricks as well as they do, they have to step back and follow the law.  Not only can he protect you from the IRS harassing you and showing up at your front door, he can get those penalties reduced and in some cases completely removed!</p>
<p>If you can’t pay on time, don’t ignore the letters or correspondence you get from the IRS. Reach out to us and we’ll schedule a no-obligation confidential consultation to explain your options to permanently resolve your tax problem. You can avoid a federal tax lien by simply filing and paying all your taxes in full and on time.</p>

<p>How long has it been? 3 years? More? 10? Some people have never filed taxes. Why not? <img class="alignright wp-image-3707 " src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Havent-Filed-Taxes-in-a-While-child-oops-shocked-face-tea-cup-1.jpg" alt="Haven't Filed Taxes in a While, child, oops, shocked face, tea cup" width="200" height="319" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“I knew I owed them, and I didn’t want to face the consequences.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“I couldn’t gather all of my records.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“My ex used to do them for me. I never learned how!”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“My accountant died.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“I’m in too deep.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“If I bring attention to the issue, the IRS is going to notice me and find things I never even <strong>realized</strong> I did wrong.”</em></p>
<h2><strong>Why Do We Have to File Tax Returns? </strong></h2>
<h2><strong><img class="alignright wp-image-3708 " src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Havent-Filed-Taxes-in-a-While-vacation-destination-beach-airplane-1.jpg" alt="" width="345" height="441" /></strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>It’s against the law not to file. This can be a felony… and you don’t it want following you the rest of your life.</li>
<li>If you’d like to buy or refinance a house, you need to prove that you’ve filed your returns.</li>
<li>If you want to get married one day, not filing can be a deal breaker because it carries <em>tons </em>of problems.</li>
<li>The IRS might file substitute-for-returns for you without deductions and you’ll owe them more than if you had just filed yourself.</li>
<li>If you owe $50,000 or more, your passport privileges will be revoked by the IRS. This means you can’t escape to Mexico before getting caught.</li>
<li>If you’re self-employed, you might miss out on increased Social Security contributions for when you retire.</li>
<li>You’re required to have filed to obtain health insurance.</li>
<li>You won’t be able to get student loan aid for your kids (FAFSA)</li>
<li>It will reduce your chances of having your identity stolen.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Do I Need to File Every Year?</strong></h2>
<p>Not typically, no. The IRS wants to see your last seven years of returns on file. However, if the IRS filed for you, you’ll want to replace the Substitute for Returns with returns of your own to reduce the balance they assessed. If you’re getting refunds and won’t owe taxes, you only have to worry about the last 4 years.</p>
<h2><strong>Alright, This is Too Much</strong></h2>
<p>Your Enrolled Agent will take thorough information on your tax situation and can handle this for you. Jeffrey A. Schneider EA, CTRS, NTPIF, ACT-E can determine exactly the number of years that need to be filed. He can find out whether the IRS has filed for you or not, find out whether or not you’ll be getting refunds that you may be entitled to, and set you up for future success.</p>

Attempting to cut your tax liability by getting into IRS grey areas can cause you problems later on. You don&#8217;t have to do anything unethical to get your return pulled for an audit; you may just have raised too many red flags. Also, an audit can be done via letter, (i.e. <a href="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/now-what-i-got-a-cp2000-notice-help/">CP2000 Notice</a>) not just face-to-face. If you’re in the middle of an audit, or owe back taxes, contact Jeffrey Schneider, EA, CTRS to resolve your tax problem(s). Here are the top 10 red flags the IRS target that you want to avoid:</p>
<h3><strong>1. Making too much money</strong></h3>
<p>First, here&#8217;s a problem most of us would dream to have. Making over $200,000! You&#8217;re honestly more likely to be audited. The fact is that there are fewer auditors, so the IRS is focusing on where they can make the most bang for their buck.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Not reporting all of your income </strong></h3>
<p>No matter how much or little you make, you have to report everything. In some way or other, unless you run a strictly cash business, all of your income is reported to the IRS. W2, 1099 and other forms you receive are duplicated, then they are sent in to the IRS. If your reported income doesn&#8217;t match theirs, you will get a notice.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Math errors </strong></h3>
<p>Your information will be entered into a computer whether you file electronically or file a paper form. Remember, the one thing computers are very good at is doing math and if things don’t add up, or there was an honest mistake while inputting the information, it can raise a red flag. A math error won&#8217;t necessarily generate an audit, but it will get the attention you may not want. Make sure to double check your returns. Better yet, have a qualified tax professional assist you and keep you out of tax trouble.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Home businesses that never make money<img class="alignright wp-image-1933" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/How-to-Avoid-Being-Audited-cartoon-woman-shocked-thinking-i-thought-i-could-just-write-it-off.jpg" alt="How to Avoid Being Audited, cartoon woman, shocked, thinking, i thought i could just write it off" width="262" height="388" /></strong></h3>
<p>Sole proprietorships that file a Schedule C year after year and always show a loss will raise a red flag. You could even show a profit, but if the profit margin is always unreasonably small, then that will get the IRS&#8217; attention.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Large charitable deductions</strong></h3>
<p>There is nothing wrong with being charitable and there is no legal limit to how much of your hard earned cash you can give away. It is another red flag, however, if your donation is different than what’s considered the norm.</p>
<h3><strong>6. Overstating business expenses</strong></h3>
<p>Depending on the type of job you have, there can be many legitimate expenses that your employer doesn&#8217;t reimburse you for. Don&#8217;t be tempted to write off just a little extra if you have your own business. These might be genuine deductions you&#8217;re considering. However, you don&#8217;t want to deduct something that&#8217;s not on the approved list and don&#8217;t claim deductions way outside the norm. Check with your tax professional – or if you don’t have one, consider Jeffrey Schneider, EA, CTRS, NPTI Fellow &#8211; who is up to date with tax laws. You don’t want to be padding your tax return with write-offs.</p>
<h3><strong>7. Sketchy real estate rental revenue or losses</strong></h3>
<p>Some people will &#8216;rent&#8217; their property to friends or family at well below market value and then claim normal rental business expenses. As with other areas, the IRS compares what you claim against local standards to determine if this is a legit business. If not, they will disallow the deductions.</p>
<h3><strong>8. Home office deductions</strong></h3>
<p>There are absolutely legitimate home office deductions but the IRS has very strict guidelines on what you can claim and how much. Try to claim too much and this is a classic red flag.</p>
<h3><strong>9. Claiming losses for things that aren&#8217;t deductible or deductible in your circumstances </strong></h3>
<p>For example, claiming day-trading losses on a Schedule C. If you dabble in stock trading and take a loss, it may or may not be deductible, but almost certainly doesn&#8217;t qualify for a Schedule C loss. You also can&#8217;t take a deduction for alimony as a business expense. The IRS maintains a list of non-deductible expenses, make sure to check that and check with your tax professional.</p>

<h3><strong>10. Claiming 100% business use of your vehicle</strong></h3>
<p>If you spend most of the time in your vehicle doing your job, you may think it&#8217;s easier just to claim the whole amount as a business expense, but this is wrong. You will either have to show your personal use, no matter how small, or have to show you have a second vehicle for personal use.</p>
