								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #000000;">In part one of this series, we talked about the case of John Spottiswood and his TurboTax return.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Back in April 2013, John Spottiswood filed his 2012, along with the $395,619 in taxes due, via TurboTax. When TurboTax submitted the return to the IRS, it was rejected. Spottiswood was unaware of the rejection and did not discover it until 18 months later when he logged into his 2012 TurboTax software. The result? The IRS slapped an estimated nearly $200,000 in penalties plus interest.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Spottiswood took his case to court.</span></p>
<h3><strong><img class="wp-image-1885 size-full alignright" src="https://sfstaxacct.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Courts-Decision-TurboTax-Not-to-Blame-for-Taxpayers-Submitted-Return-Rejection-Taxpayer-on-the-Hook-for-an-Estimated-200000-in-Penalties-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-shocked-cute-animal.png" alt="" width="486" height="438" /><span style="color: #000000;">Interest and Penalties? </span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Interestingly, Spottiswood did not fight the IRS on the interest. However, he requested that the penalties – both the late filing and late payment penalties, which could total nearly $200,000 over 18 months </span>–<span style="color: #000000;"> be abated.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">His reasoning was that he was unaware that there was even a possibility that his return filed with TurboTax could be rejected.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“Intuit may have informed me in the fine print that I needed to log back in to make sure that my return had not been rejected, but if so I did not read this fine print,” said Spottiswood in a statement to the IRS.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>(Not a Satisfactory) Outcome </strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In the end, TurboTax was found not to be to blame for the Spottiswood’s late filing or late payment of their 2012 taxes.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The court sided with the IRS in upholding all penalties, so those will come out of the Spottiswood’s pockets.</span></p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-1886 alignleft" src="https://sfstaxacct.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Courts-Decision-TurboTax-Not-to-Blame-for-Taxpayers-Submitted-Return-Rejection-Taxpayer-on-the-Hook-for-an-Estimated-200000-in-Penalties-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-wrong-way-sign-300x176.png" alt="Courts Decision, TurboTax Not to Blame for Taxpayers Submitted Return Rejection, Taxpayer on the Hook for an Estimated 200000 in Penalties, SFS Tax Problem Solutions, wrong way sign" width="300" height="176" /><span style="color: #000000;">This is a key difference between using an online tax system versus a qualified professional such as an Enrolled Agent (EA). Your EA will file your return directly with the IRS and follow up to make sure it was accepted. If not, they (or their staff) will continue contacting you until the return is corrected and filed.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Lesson Learned</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">First, it pays to have a professional on your side when it comes to taxes. Had the Spottiswoods consulted an EA, their return would not have been filed late. Second, if you do have to go up against the IRS, as the Spottiswoods did, the expert advice of an EA is invaluable.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">With cases such as these, there are circumstances under which some (or all) or those penalties could be abated. As a tax professional who must meet stringent requirements and continue their study of tax law, EAs know all of the rules and the ways to help taxpayers in trouble.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">However, if you don’t receive that advice, you won’t be aware of it and use it to your advantage.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">What you don’t know can hurt you… big time. The Spottiswoods found out the hard way. Learn from their example and don’t let this happen to you!</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Don&#8217;t File a Tax Return, Go to Jail? It Could Happen to This Police Commissioner. An SFS Tax Problem Solutions Blog. </em></p>
<p>Baltimore Police Commissioner Darryl De Sousa is facing up to three years of jail time and a $75,000 sentence for failing to file federal tax returns in 2013, 2014 and 2015.</p>
<p>The average (and even not-so-average person) would be shaking in his or her shoes at the thought of the IRS coming after them with criminal charges.</p>
<h2><strong>So is this a rare occurrence? </strong></h2>
<p>According to the IRS’s website, there are approximately 3,000 criminal prosecutions a year. It does not state how many of these cases are for tax fraud, tax evasion or failure to file.</p>
<p>When you consider that the IRS receives approximately 150 million individual returns a year, it is a very low number (about 0.002% of all returns filed).</p>
<p>Of course, that’s no consultation if you are one of the 3,000 people whom the IRS prosecutes.</p>
<h2><strong><img class="size-medium wp-image-1200 alignright" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Dont-File-a-Return-Go-to-Jail-It-Could-Happen-to-this-Police-Commissioner-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Woman-Looking-for-Evidence-silhouette-woman-silhouette-magnifying-glass-300x250.png" alt="Dont File a Return, Go to Jail It Could Happen to this Police Commissioner, SFS Tax Problem Solutions, Woman Looking for Evidence, silhouette, woman silhouette, magnifying glass" width="300" height="250" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Dont-File-a-Return-Go-to-Jail-It-Could-Happen-to-this-Police-Commissioner-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Woman-Looking-for-Evidence-silhouette-woman-silhouette-magnifying-glass-300x250.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Dont-File-a-Return-Go-to-Jail-It-Could-Happen-to-this-Police-Commissioner-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Woman-Looking-for-Evidence-silhouette-woman-silhouette-magnifying-glass.png 633w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The life-ruining effects of being prosecuted by the IRS </strong></h2>
<p>In De Sousa’s case, it has cost him his career.</p>
<p>De Sousa was a 30-year veteran of the police force. After the charges came to light, he was suspended from his position, only to resign a few days later. He had just been appointed commissioner in January.</p>
<p>At his tax hearing on Monday, May 21, De Sousa agreed to surrender his firearms and passport. He is currently free while awaiting trial. No court date has been set yet.</p>
<p>For his part, he said in a statement that while he did not file returns, he did have taxes withheld from his paycheck. He also filed a return in 2016 and has filed for an extension in 2017.</p>
<p>He also said “I fully admit to failing to file my personal federal and state taxes for 2013, 2014 and 2015. While there is no excuse for my failure to fulfill my obligations as a citizen and public official, my only explanation is that I failed to sufficiently prioritize my personal affairs.”</p>
<h2><strong>What can we learn from this?</strong></h2>
<p>As for De Sousa, we can hope for that he was eligible for a refund for each of those three years he didn&#8217;t file a tax return. There is no penalty for not filing if the government owes you money. You should still file a return anyway. Otherwise, you can’t claim the refund.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/bs-md-ci-de-sousa-appearance-20180521-story.html">As reported by the <em>Baltimore Sun</em></a>, the IRS issued subpoenas for De Sousa’s pay and related information. This includes secondary jobs, travel and internal affairs files – from the last decade.</p>
<p>Many people don’t realize that anyone who pays you (even if you are an independent contractor) must let the IRS know they have done so. And in a timely manner.</p>
<p>The IRS matches what they receive from employers (and banks, etc.) against your tax return.</p>
<p>And obviously, as in De Sousa’s case, they can subpoena whatever they don’t already have.</p>

<p>If you, like De Sousa, haven’t filed a tax return for any year, you should contact a tax professional right away.</p>
<p>It’s so much better if you take steps toward fixing your situation, rather than letting the IRS come to you.</p>
