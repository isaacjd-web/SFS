								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Part One of a Two-Part Series</strong></em></h5>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">It was just days before the tax deadline in April 2013. John Spottiswood prepared his joint return for himself and his wife and submitted it to TurboTax. Along with his return was an authorization to deduct from his checking account the balance of tax due, totaling $395,619.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Thinking his return had been successfully e-filed, he logged off and resumed his regular life.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">That was not the end of the story, however.</span></p>
<h3><strong>What Happens After You E-File with TurboTax? </strong></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">When you use an online program like TurboTax, you are submitting your return to them – and not directly to the U.S. Federal Treasury.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">TurboTax has to, in turn, submit your return to the IRS, which they did in Spottiswood’s case.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">However, the IRS rejected it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Why? Because a dependent’s Social Security Number was input incorrectly.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Input errors are an unfortunate part of preparing returns.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">However, qualified tax professionals such as Enrolled Agents (EAs) take responsibility for those errors and work to correct them. TurboTax takes no such responsibility.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Online Software Tax Return Preparation:  You’re On Your Own</strong></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">TurboTax did send an email to Spottiswood notifying him that his return had been rejected – however, that was the only notice sent from TurboTax to Spottiswood. Spottiswood did not check the status of the return, nor did he notice that the balance due had not been withdrawn from his checking account.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In fact, Spottiswood did not become aware of the problem until he logged back into his TurboTax 2012 software.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">With a clogged email inbox, it’s easy to miss a single notice like the one TurboTax sent to Spottiswood.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">With a qualified EA, though, you can be sure you will receive multiple phone calls and emails that will continue until the problem is resolved – and not a year or two later.</span></p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-1252 alignright" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Courts-Decision-TurboTax-Not-to-Blame-for-Taxpayers-Submitted-Return-Rejection-Taxpayer-on-the-Hook-for-an-Estimated-200000-in-Penalties-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-reading-the-fine-print-296x300.png" alt="Courts Decision, TurboTax Not to Blame for Taxpayers Submitted Return Rejection, Taxpayer on the Hook for an Estimated 200000 in Penalties, SFS Tax Problem Solutions, reading the fine print" width="296" height="300" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Courts-Decision-TurboTax-Not-to-Blame-for-Taxpayers-Submitted-Return-Rejection-Taxpayer-on-the-Hook-for-an-Estimated-200000-in-Penalties-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-reading-the-fine-print-296x300.png 296w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Courts-Decision-TurboTax-Not-to-Blame-for-Taxpayers-Submitted-Return-Rejection-Taxpayer-on-the-Hook-for-an-Estimated-200000-in-Penalties-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-reading-the-fine-print.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 296px) 100vw, 296px" /></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Who’s to Blame? According to the Courts, not TurboTax</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">According to a statement Spottiswood made to the IRS, he wasn’t even aware there was a possibility that his return could be rejected.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“If I had realized that there was a chance of rejection I would have mailed my return,” said Spottiswood in the statement, “but e-filing seemed like an easier option and it was free with the software. Intuit may have informed me in the fine print that I needed to log back in to make sure that my return had not been rejected, but if so I did not read this fine print. Had I logged back in a few days later I would have realized that the return had been </span>rejected.<span style="color: #000000;">  But I did not log back in until 18 months later.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">That’s 18 months of late payment penalties, late filing penalties and interest accumulated on top of the nearly $400,000 tax debt.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This costly mistake could have been prevented by going to an EA or other qualified tax preparers who will ensure that your tax return is accepted by the IRS.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">Once Spottiswood was made aware of the issue, he refiled the return and paid the tax due… on January 7, 2015, nearly two years after the original due date. He paid the interest assessed by the IRS but fought the penalty.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Not including interest, the failure to file and failure to pay penalties on $395,619 of back taxes?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We are talking $170,117… a nearly $200,000 error.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>So What Happened? </strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The Spottiswoods fought the matter and the case went to court.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In part two, we examine the case and the verdict as well as what it means to TurboTax users everywhere.</span></p>

<p><strong> </strong>Thinking about doing your tax return has been known to cause headaches and pains in the neck and well… other areas.</p>
<p>Next time tell her you are taking her on an extended vacation, and sneak the return in, really quick-like.</p>

<p>Might we suggest some dog treats? Or food for that matter? Sounds like you’ve been starving that dog.</p>
<p>And by the way… did you believe your kids about the homework?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our condolences on the loss of your accountant… a good one can be hard to find. You should be able to get an extension and transcripts of previous year’s returns from the IRS though as a starting point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
