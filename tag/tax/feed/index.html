<p>Though our firm specializes in helping people resolve their IRS or state back tax problems, we also love saving you money. After all, one of the best ways to avoid getting into tax trouble is to minimize your liabilities.</p>
<h2><strong><img class="alignright wp-image-2683" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Year-End-Tax-Saving-Strategies-girl-writing-sticky-notes.jpg" alt="" width="374" height="223" /></strong></h2>
<p>The end of the year is the perfect time to review your finances and the perfect time to make some smart tax-saving moves. Making the right moves at the end of the year can possibly reduce your tax liability and allow you to keep more of what you earn.</p>
<p>From accelerating expenses to boosting the amount you put away for retirement, there are things you can do to lower your tax burden. You may not be able to control the tax fight in Washington, but you can limit the amount you pay by assessing your own tax situation and making some prudent changes.</p>
<h2><strong>Accelerate Your Expenses</strong></h2>
<p>Individual taxpayers are on the cash basis for income tax purposes. This means your income is taxable when you receive it and expenses count when you pay them. Depending on your situation, shifting deductions between years can make a big difference on your tax bill. With this knowledge, making additional deductible payments prior to the end of the year may be a good idea. Examples include property tax payments, mortgage interest payments, and charitable donations.</p>
<h2><strong>Boost Your 401(k) Contributions </strong></h2>
<h2><strong><img class="alignright wp-image-2684" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Year-End-Tax-Saving-Strategies-girl-writing-white-board.jpg" alt="Year-End Tax Saving Strategies, girl, writing, white board" width="604" height="903" /></strong></h2>
<p>As the year ticks down to its close, it pays to look at your most recent pay stub and see how much you have already contributed to your 401(k) plan. Contributing to a 401(k) plan is an excellent way to save on taxes since every dollar you put in is deducted from your taxable income.</p>
<p>For 2018, you can contribute up to $18,500 to your 401(k) plan, plus an extra 6,000  if you are 50 or older. Also, if you have not yet maxed out your 401(k), now is the perfect time to boost your contributions and make up for lost time.  Keep in mind that many companies allow you to change your contribution percentage any time you wish. Boosting the amount you put in between now and the end of the year can make a huge difference. You can adjust your contribution downward in the new year if you wish, but at least consider leaving it at its new elevated level.</p>
<h2><strong>Gather Your Donations</strong></h2>
<p style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 200%; font-family: 'Microsoft Sans Serif','sans-serif';">Donating to charity makes you feel good, but it can also be good for your wallet. If you itemize your deductions, you may be able to take a deduction for not only cash contributions but gifts of household goods and clothing as well.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 200%; font-family: 'Microsoft Sans Serif','sans-serif';">Take a few minutes this weekend to go through your closets and storage areas. First, look for usable items you no longer need. Box them up and take them down to your local thrift store or other charity. Be sure to get a receipt that shows what you donated, along with the approximate value. </span></p>
<h2><strong>Contact Your Enrolled Agent</strong></h2>
<p style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 200%; font-family: 'Microsoft Sans Serif','sans-serif';">This is a short list of some of the ideas you can use to lower your tax obligation in 2018. If you need an expert tax resolution professional, reach out to us and we’ll schedule a no-obligation confidential consultation. Jeffrey Schneider, EA, CTRS will explain your options and help permanently resolve your tax problem.</span></p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>More Recent Tax Cases You’ll Enjoy Reading About (Tax Fraud)</strong></h1>
<p>If you liked our <a href="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/tax-cases/">last</a> stories, these will blow you away.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-2668" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/More-Recent-Tax-Cases-You’ll-Enjoy-Reading-About-Tax-Fraud-Shirley-New-York-NYC.jpg" alt="More Recent Tax Cases You’ll Enjoy Reading About (Tax Fraud), Shirley, New York, NYC" width="282" height="222" /></p>
<h3><strong>Shirley, N.Y.</strong></h3>
<p>In our first short story, we’ll introduce Fred Towle Jr., 52. Towle pleaded guilty to endorsing a false return for 2012 that underreported his business income.</p>
<p>Towle owned the company East Coast Marketing. He used this company to consult with political candidates and assist homeowners for his own gain. Furthermore, he was expediting approvals for permits from various governmental entities in Suffolk County, N.Y.</p>
<p>Towle’s fraudulent activity began in 2012. He falsely reported no taxable income from businesses controlled by him, including East Coast Marketing. Knowing that he was earning approximately $246,000 in taxable corporate income for that year, he still claimed nothing.<br />
Between tax years 2012 and 2014, Towle failed to declare approximately $1.2 million in income; this resulted in a tax loss to the U.S. of some $307,427.</p>
<p>Towle faces a maximum of three years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. His plea included an agreement to pay $307,427 in restitution, which was the full amount of his tax liabilities.</p>
<h3><strong>Hamden, Conn. <img class="alignright  wp-image-2669" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/More-Recent-Tax-Cases-You’ll-Enjoy-Reading-About-Tax-Fraud-Hamden-Connecticut-CT.jpg" alt="More Recent Tax Cases You’ll Enjoy Reading About (Tax Fraud), Hamden, Connecticut, CT" width="361" height="240" /></strong></h3>
<p>Next, we have Ira Malkin, 49. This salesman is guilty of tax evasion, and was sentenced six months in prison. He also has three years of supervised release.</p>
<p>Malkin worked as a principal salesman for Good Copy Printing Center Inc., New Haven -according to court documents and statements in court. He earned substantial commissions and GCP paid many of Malkin’s personal expenses.</p>
<p>With Malkin’s consent, GCP reduced his commissions by the amount of personal expenses the company paid. He then reported to the IRS that Malkin had earned substantially less income than he truly earned.</p>
<p>In a second scenario, GCP handled printing jobs for Comcast. GCP mailed flyers and paid the postage with the expectation that the company would be reimbursed for that expense. Malkin had GCP pay the postage for the Comcast mailings and made Comcast reimburse him for the cost of the mailings. GCP reduced his earned commissions by the amount of postage paid by GCP. Through this arrangement, between approximately 2009 and 2012 GCP further under-reported Malkin’s income on filed W-2s.</p>
<p>Through this scheme, Malkin underreported more than $1.5 million in income. He skipped out on $484,581 in federal income taxes! Even though he pleaded guilty in February and paid all of his back taxes, Malkin still owes the IRS more than $700,000 in interest and penalties.</p>
<p>During his supervised release, he must spend six months in home confinement and perform 200 hours of community service.</p>
<h3><strong><img class="alignleft  wp-image-2670" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/More-Recent-Tax-Cases-You’ll-Enjoy-Reading-About-Tax-Fraud-Fairfield-Ohio.jpg" alt="More Recent Tax Cases You’ll Enjoy Reading About (Tax Fraud), Fairfield, Ohio" width="298" height="227" />Fairfield, Ohio</strong></h3>
<p>Preparer Janet Benitez, 44, who prepared returns for illegal aliens and concealed her own income, pleaded guilty to filing a false income tax return, according to published reports.</p>
<p>During the course of 5 years, Benitez reportedly submitted returns on behalf of 23 illegal aliens seeking fraudulent refunds of at least $123,999. She not only failed to report her prep fees for tax years 2011 through 2015, but she filed false income tax returns in her name and her spouse’s name when she should have filed one return that combined their income. However, this would have resulted in tax due… apparently a cost she didn’t want to pay.</p>
<p>She has reportedly agreed to pay $265,839 in restitution to the IRS.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Filing a false income tax return carries a maximum of three years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.</p>
<h3><strong>Peabody, Mass. <img class="alignright  wp-image-2671" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/More-Recent-Tax-Cases-You’ll-Enjoy-Reading-About-Tax-Fraud-Peabody-Massachusetts-MA.jpg" alt="More Recent Tax Cases You’ll Enjoy Reading About (Tax Fraud), Peabody, Massachusetts, MA" width="339" height="240" /></strong></h3>
<p>William Panousos, 67; his wife, Theodora, 65; and their son, Konstantinos, 39 were taken down as family. These current and former owners of Giovanni’s Roast Beef &amp; Pizza have been sentenced in connection with skimming cash receipts from Giovanni’s and failing to report the cash on their tax returns. They avoided payment of some $550,000 in taxes.</p>
<p>The family each received three years’ probation, with the first 18 months confined to the City of Peabody. Next, they were ordered to pay a fine of $150,000. They were also ordered to pay restitution of $549,883 to the IRS.</p>
<p>In November, all three pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud the U.S. William Panousos also pleaded guilty to three counts of aiding and assisting in filing false corporate and individual returns. Theodora pleaded guilty to four counts and Konstantinos to two.</p>
<p>During tax years 2013 through 2015, the Panousoses skimmed some $2.8 million in cash receipts from Giovanni’s and did not deposit them into the business’ bank account or report them to their preparer. They diverted about $1.5 million of those cash receipts to their own personal use. They used the rest of the skimmed cash to pay some of their business expenses, including a portion of payments to suppliers and a portion of employees’ salaries. In addition, the defendants failed to report those cash expenses on their returns.</p>
<h3><strong><img class="alignleft  wp-image-2672" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/More-Recent-Tax-Cases-You’ll-Enjoy-Reading-About-Tax-Fraud-Whiting-Ohio-OH.jpg" alt="More Recent Tax Cases You’ll Enjoy Reading About (Tax Fraud), Whiting, Ohio, OH" width="340" height="249" />Whiting, Iowa</strong></h3>
<p>Farmer Kurt Neldeberg, 65, filed false and fraudulent returns and has been sentenced to two years’ probation.</p>
<p>Neldeberg pleaded guilty in February. He admitted that from at least 2009 through 2012, he failed to report some $315,512 in income from grain sales. This resulted in more than $100,000 in unpaid taxes due and owing.</p>
<p>He admitted that he deposited proceeds from farm grain sales into personal bank accounts and failed to inform his bookkeeper and his preparer that he had done so. His farm receipts on Schedule F of his joint federal returns resulted in under-reported income for each of the tax years 2009 through 2012.</p>
<p>Neldeberg was also ordered to complete 120 hours of community service, to pay a $100 special assessment and to make full restitution to the IRS. Neldeberg previously posted a $125,000 cash bond to the IRS for restitution.</p>
<h3><strong>St. Louis<img class="alignright  wp-image-2674" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/More-Recent-Tax-Cases-You’ll-Enjoy-Reading-About-Tax-Fraud-St-Louis-Missouri-MO.jpg" alt="More Recent Tax Cases You’ll Enjoy Reading About (Tax Fraud), St Louis, Missouri, MO" width="352" height="197" /> </strong></h3>
<p>Prep-service operator Asmerom “Ace” Keleta, 33, has been sentenced to five years in prison for conspiring to defraud the U.S. through tax fraud and for preparing fraudulent returns.</p>
<p>According to court documents, Keleta operated University City Tax Service starting in 2012. He conspired with employees Miyoshi Lewis and Teklom Paulos to prepare fraudulent returns for clients. Keleta directed the employees to inflate refunds by listing false American Opportunity Credits and federal fuel tax credits. He also created false Schedule C income to fraudulently maximize Earned Income Tax Credits.</p>
<p>Keleta also prepared false returns for clients and, as owner of University City Tax, received a percentage of clients’ inflated refunds.</p>
<p>He was also ordered to pay $662,645 in restitution.</p>
<h3><strong> </strong></h3>

<h3><strong>Atlanta</strong></h3>
<p>A federal court has barred preparer Marjorie St. Jean and MarjorieStjeanLLC from preparing federal returns for others and owning or operating a prep business.</p>
<p>The court also ordered that St. Jean and MarjorieStjeanLLC pay $367,346.14, representing the gains for the preparation of returns making false claims.</p>
<p>St. Jean and MarjorieStjeanLLC, an entity through which she operates prep stores, prepared returns that included fraudulent claims for the EITC, often based on bogus dependents, fabricated business income and expenses or false filing statuses. The court also determined that MarjorieStjeanLLC often prepared returns that falsely claimed fuel tax credits, household help income, unreimbursed employee business expenses and self-employment income or expenses.</p>

<p>Demolition executive Hugo Santamaria has been sentenced to two years in prison for tax and structuring crimes.</p>
<p>According to case documents and information, Santamaria pleaded guilty in August 2017 to structuring cash transactions to avoid currency transaction reports and conspiring to defraud the U.S. Beginning in 2006, Santamaria owned and operated multiple demolition companies and conspired with his business partner in those companies to conceal income from the IRS and evade personal income taxes.</p>
<p>He engaged in such acts of evasion as opening bank accounts for his co-conspirator to hide income and serving as a nominee for his co-conspirator’s businesses. Santamaria also wrote, signed and cashed numerous checks and made cash withdrawals in amounts less than $10,000 on consecutive days. He and his co-conspirator also paid workers in cash and failed to withhold and pay over any payroll taxes.</p>
<p>Santamaria admitted to paying himself a weekly salary from company bank accounts. He also admitted a number of crimes, including paying personal expenses with the business bank accounts. This includes food, lodging, clothing, gym memberships and tuition for private school. Simultaneously, he has not filed a personal tax return since 2007.</p>
<h6>The Sentencing</h6>
<p>They ordered Santamaria three years of supervised release and to pay $26,213 in restitution to the IRS.</p>
<h4><strong>Amherst, N.Y.</strong></h4>
<p>Realtor Maxim Levin, 40, has pleaded guilty to filing a false tax return.</p>
<p>From 2012 to 2015, Levin operated Glebova Realty Group. This group purchased, renovated and sold real estate throughout the Buffalo, N.Y., area. During those years, Levin did file federal income tax returns. However, he failed to accurately report the gross receipts that he earned from his real estate business to the IRS. As you might assume, he also failed to pay taxes on such income. He caused more than $3.1 million of gross receipts from his real estate business to be excluded from his returns. This resulted in a tax loss of $161,606.</p>
<h6>The Sentencing</h6>
<p>The charge carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a $250,000 fine.</p>
<h4><strong>Waialua, Hawaii</strong></h4>
<p>The court convicted Preparer Guillermo Dahilig of aiding and assisting in the preparation and filing of false returns. The court sentenced him 18 months in prison. <img class="alignright  wp-image-2456" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/7-Recent-Tax-Cases-You’ll-Enjoy-Reading-About-cars-crowd-daylight.jpg" alt="7 Recent Tax Cases You’ll Enjoy Reading About, cars, crowd, daylight" width="263" height="249" /></p>
<p>According to court documents and case information, from 2009 to 2016 Dahilig owned and operated Speedy Gill Services, an Oahu tax prep business. He prepared 750 to 1,000 returns per year for clients and charged $100 to $200 per return. To inflate refunds, he falsified clients’ returns with deductions for items such as medical expenses, personal property tax, job expenses and charitable contributions that he knew were greater than the figures provided by his clients. From at least 2010 through 2013, he also underreported the income of Speedy Gill on the returns he prepared and filed for himself and his wife.</p>
<p>Following his incarceration, Dahilig will be on supervised release for a year. They&#8217;ve also ordered him to pay $318,222 in restitution to the IRS.</p>
<h4><strong>New York </strong></h4>
<p>CPA and attorney Steven Etkind has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the U.S. and tax evasion arising from a scheme to embezzle millions from a deceased client’s estate.</p>
<p>According to court documents and statements in court, Etkind was a partner at a New York law firm’s tax, trusts and estates group. He performed legal work for a successful entrepreneur client. The client then died in 2008, naming Etkind as the co-executor of his $35 million estate.</p>
<p>The client’s will directed the creation of two charitable trust private foundations, funded with assets from the client’s estate, for the sole purpose of donating to 501(c)(3) organizations, including those aimed at assisting Jewish-sponsored organizations. Etkind was the co-trustee of these trusts.</p>
<h6>The Background</h6>
<p>Beginning in 2009, Etkind and his co-conspirator set up a phony charitable organization, the United Jewish Education Foundation, and used it to steal more than $3.5 million from these charitable trusts. Then, Etkind directed that donations from the trusts be first made to legitimate Jewish charitable organizations to give the disbursements the appearance of legitimate donations. The criminal and his co-conspirator then redirected the funds to accounts of the UJEF, the phony charity that his co-conspirator controlled.</p>
<p>Etkind subsequently directed his co-conspirator to write checks, totaling $327,500, to a bank account in the name of JE Capital Holding Corp., a nominee corporate entity that Etkind controlled exclusively. He further directed more than $3 million to be used in 2010 to purchase a 6,300 square-foot home with a swimming pool in Southampton, N.Y. Etkind later transferred title of the property to JE Trust, a nominee trust he controlled.</p>
<p>Etkind filed and caused to be filed fraudulent personal, corporate and charitable trust returns with the IRS. This was solely to conceal his embezzlement. During a subsequent IRS audit of UJEF, Etkind and his co-conspirator made several false and misleading statements, including about the true ownership of the Southampton property.</p>
<h6>The Sentencing</h6>
<p>Sentencing is Jan. 18. Etkind faces a maximum of five years in prison on the conspiracy charge and five years for tax evasion. He also faces a period of supervised release, restitution, and monetary penalties.</p>
<h4><strong>Ft. Myers, Fla.</strong></h4>
<p>Resident Attila Kalmar has been sentenced to 18 months in prison. Get this: he was stealing government funds and endeavoring to obstruct internal revenue laws. According to court documents, Kalmar filed 2007 through 2009 trust returns with the IRS in the name of First AK-Open Sec Trust, a nominee entity, seeking more than $480,000 in fraudulent refunds. He deposited a refund check he received as a result of these filings into a bank account. Afterward, he used the proceeds to purchase real property, acquire thousands of dollars in gold coins and wire money overseas.</p>
<p>He tried to impede the internal revenue laws by transferring funds between nominee bank accounts. Also, he falsely represented to the IRS that an IRS revenue officer was the trustee for First AK-Open Sec Trust.</p>
<h6>The Sentencing</h6>
<p>In addition to the term of prison imposed, the courts ordered Kalmar to serve three years of supervised release. He forfeited $274,019, a piece of real estate to the U.S. and paid $274,019 in restitution to the IRS.</p>

<p>Cannabis, Marijuana, Weed, Pot, Mary Jane &#8211; a rose by any other name is still a rose.  No matter what you want to call it, the industry surrounding this drug faces many uphill battles.  It does not matter if you grow it, cultivate it, distribute it or dispense it, if you are in this industry or are looking to become part of the industry, you have tax and accounting issues that most businesses would not and could not imagine.</p>
<p>First and foremost, no matter what your state says (more on that later), Cannabis is an illegal drug for federal purposes. There are 5 categories in which drugs are lumped.  Heroin and LSD, as one might expect is placed in the first category.  You must be thinking “What does these two dangerous and addictive drugs have to do with pot?”  Well, a lot.  In fact, marijuana has been placed in this category and is considered a dangerous drug.</p>
<p>That’s the federal government for you.  It is a political hotbed, to say the list.  However, we will not go there, as this not a political blog.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-1594 alignleft" title="Cannabis Taxation Controversy and Confusion, where is marijuana legal, what states can use cannabis" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/map.png" alt="" width="361" height="258" /></p>
<p>Now what about all the states?  44 states, including Washington DC and Guam have individually legalized the use of marijuana in some form or another.  The use ranges from medical to recreational to growing.  Each state passed their own laws, their own regulations and their own procedures on how to control the industry in their state.</p>
<h4><strong>Controversy: Federal Law vs. State Law</strong></h4>
<p>So how does this conflict between the Federal government and the states co-exist?  Well, the federal government has indicated that they will not crack down on these businesses. That does not mean they won’t.  In fact, in a recent tax case, part of the issue was the deductibility of over $600,000 worth of product confiscated by the Feds… it wasn’t allowed as a deduction. It is, after all, illegal as far as the Federal government is concerned.</p>
<p>Now, when it comes to taxes &#8211; for Federal tax purposes, the IRS, because it is an illegal business endeavor, will not allow for any tax deductions (deductible expense) against the income generated by this business.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1593 " title="Cannabis Taxation Controversy and Confusion, Al Capone, Al Capone Quotes, City" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Al-Capone-Quote.jpg" alt="" width="436" height="199" /></p>
<h4><strong>So Why Report it on my Federal Income Tax Return?</strong></h4>
<p>You may not be aware, that there is an Internal Revenue Code Section (61) that, very specifically states, that all income is taxable from whatever source derived.  Think of Al Capone.  What was he sent to prison for?  Murder? Prostitution? Bootlegging?  Not a chance.  It was tax evasion.  He never reported his illegally received gains on a tax return.</p>
<p>So what happens to these businesses that are operating illegally for federal purposes, but legally for state?  Well, they better be reporting their gross income on the appropriate individual corporate or partnership tax return.  Oh, yes, trusts and estates can be involved, too.</p>
<p>How about deductions since it is mentioned that the IRS will not allow any deduction?  Congress enacted Internal Revenue Code Section 280E to get people to file returns and report this income, even if it’s considered illegal income.  This section says that cost of goods sold will be allowed as a <em><strong>reduction</strong></em> (not <strong>deduction</strong>) against gross sales. Semantics?  Maybe, but the courts have ruled that cost of goods sold is an adjustment in arriving at net sales. Remember, a rose by any other name…..?  Whatever reason, it helps.  Not entirely, but it helps.</p>
<p>But you can’t just call something “cost of goods” to reduce your taxes. There are very specific rules to follow… with court cases to back them up.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, in most cases, you cannot open a bank account if you are affiliated with this industry. This means you have to deal with cash, cannot take credit cards and cannot deposit the wads of cash you carry into a bank.  You better have a very large, very secure safe.</p>
<p>If you have employees, you have to pay them in cash.  For those of you that have payroll, you may know that you are required to make your payroll tax deposits electronically. This enlies the next question:</p>
<p><em><strong>How Can We Do This Without a Bank Account?</strong></em></p>
<p>This will be one of your biggest challenges, especially when the IRS can penalize you for not making these deposits electronically.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-1595" title="Cannabis Taxation Controversy and Confusion, frog, growers, distributors" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/frog-cannabis-clones-sm.jpg" alt="" width="435" height="356" /></p>
<p>To fight this, you need to make sure that you have a professional that understands the nuances of 280E, how to set up your business when you may have an ancillary shop (i.e., one that offers counseling, munchies, or even paraphernalia) and to handle any issues that arise with the IRS or the state.  The states, like Colorado, have indicated that they WILL audit every business every few years and they have. Not for the reason you may think why a business may get audited, but for licensing reasons.  The IRS will also come in to audit a business to question as to what went into the 280E numbers claimed on the return.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Schneider, EA, CTRS has trained and learned what each business needs to pass muster.  He has read the statutes, regulations and court cases to help you muddle through the mind field of this industry.  In fact, Schneider travels the country teaching other tax pros on this subject.</p>
<p>So if you are a part of &#8211; or thinking of getting into &#8211; the cannabis industry, find a pro that knows this industry well. If you are thinking about starting a sidekick business as was mentioned before, make sure your pro understand how to get the most out of 280E.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As you will see, the IRS has a lot of power to collect a federal tax debt. As far-reaching and mighty as those powers may seem, they are <em>not</em> unlimited.</p>
<h3><strong>What the IRS Can’t Do </strong></h3>
<h4><strong>The IRS Can’t Put You in Jail for Owing Tax</strong></h4>
<p><strong> </strong>You may have an outstanding tax debt, but you won’t go to jail for it. You could be prosecuted for falsifying tax returns or trying to evade taxes. However, if you file a return (on time, even if it’s the extended deadline) and you simply can’t pay? You cannot be hauled off to jail for that.</p>
<h4><strong>The IRS Can’t Take Collection Action Against You without Due Process</strong></h4>
<p>You will be notified of any delinquent taxes and given the opportunity to refute or appeal any decision. The IRS is not going to show up at your door unless you’ve already agreed to meet them there. The first contact from the IRS is usually by mail.</p>
<h4><strong>The IRS Can’t Seize Your Property if… </strong></h4>
<p><strong> </strong>If you have submitted an installment agreement (or have an approved agreement) to pay what you owe, the IRS won’t seize your property. Likewise, your property is safe while the IRS considers your Offer in Compromise. Also, if the IRS deems you unable to pay because of your financial situation, they will not seize your property.  In this case, the IRS determines that you would be unable to meet basic living expenses if they move forward with collection activity.</p>

<h3><strong>What the IRS Can Do </strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Issue a Summons for Financial Information </strong></h4>
<p><strong> </strong>Are you unwilling or unable to provide the paperwork the IRS is looking for? No problem – they can issue a summons and the court will likely uphold it. The IRS already has third-party information on you from your employers, your bank, and anyone who has paid you dividends or other income. If IRS needs more information, rest assured, they will get it.</p>
<h4><strong>File a Tax Lien Against your Social Security Number</strong></h4>
<p>A tax lien shows up on every credit report, each time you apply for credit.</p>
<p>It affects your credit score and your ability to buy a home or car. If you are job hunting, it will show up if your employer does a credit check on you, possibly preventing you from getting the job.</p>
<h4><strong>Garnish your Wages</strong></h4>
<p>The IRS can have your employer withhold money from your paycheck. How much money? It depends on how much your make, the number of exceptions you claim, and your filing status. The <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p1494.pdf">IRS figures how much you need to live on</a> and takes the rest. For example, a single filer with one dependent gets $1,345.83 a month for all living expenses. The rest of the paycheck goes toward paying off back tax debt.</p>
<h4><strong>Levy your Bank Accounts</strong></h4>
<p>The IRS can take money directly out of your bank accounts to pay your tax debt. This includes retirement accounts as well as the cash loan value of your life insurance, rental income, and dividends from stocks.</p>
<h4><strong>Seize your Home, Vehicle, or Boat</strong></h4>
<p><strong> </strong>The <a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/what-is-a-levy">IRS can seize any property you own</a> and sell it to satisfy your tax debt. After tax is assessed and a Notice and Demand for Payment is sent and ignored, another Final Notice of Intent to Levy and Notice of Your Right to A Hearing is sent at least 30 days before the levy is assessed.</p>
<h4><strong> </strong><strong>Revoke your passport</strong></h4>
<p><strong> </strong>Plan on traveling outside the U.S.? You may want to think twice if you are seriously delinquent on $50,000 or more of back taxes. Your passport may be subject to limitations or even revoked by the IRS.</p>
<h4><strong>Have a Private Collection Agency Try to Collect from You </strong></h4>
<p><strong> </strong>Current law allows the IRS to outsource collection of your tax debt to <a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/private-debt-collection">a private collection agency</a>. These are the four agencies that the IRS is currently working with:</p>
<ol>
<li>CBE</li>
</ol>
<p>P.O. Box 2217</p>
<p>Waterloo, IA 50704</p>
<p>(800) 910-5837</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>ConServe</li>
</ol>
<p>P.O. Box 307</p>
<p>Fairport, NY 14450-0307</p>
<p>(844) 853-4875</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Performant</li>
</ol>
<p>P.O. Box 9045</p>
<p>Pleasanton, CA 94566-9045</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Pioneer</li>
</ol>
<p>P.O. Box 500</p>
<p>Horseheads, NY 14845</p>
<p>(800) 448-3531</p>
<p>The IRS gives notice through mail if it is turning your tax debt over to a private collection agency. Then, another notice will come from the collection agency itself. If this has happened to you – and you do not want to be contacted by the private collection agency – you can submit a written request to the agency. (Addresses provided for your convenience).</p>
<p>Given the broad collection powers of the IRS, it’s wise to deal with any tax issues right away. Even if a lien or levy has already in place, there are ways to improve your situation. You need the help of an Enrolled Agent, one of America’s Tax Experts, to help guide you through this process.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A law firm tied to Stormy Daniel’s attorney is in hot water with the IRS over a missed back tax payment of over $440,000 that was due the week of May 14.</p>
<p>Michael Avenatti <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5759331/Judge-orders-law-firm-Stormy-Daniels-lawyer-pay-10M.html">“personally guaranteed” the payments</a>, according to court records as reported by the <em>Daily Mail.</em></p>
<p>He could soon be the subject of legal action by the government.</p>
<p>As reported in the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, Avenatti and his firm, Eagan Avenatti, agreed to pay the IRS $2.4 million to settle their back tax bill in January.</p>
<p>Over 50% of that amount – $1.3 million of the $2.4 million – was for payroll taxes that had been withheld from employee’s paychecks.</p>
<p>However, the firm failed to turn those monies over to the federal government.</p>
<p>Avenatti made an initial payment of $1.5 million, leaving it with an approximately $880,000 remaining balance.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-1225 size-medium" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Stormy-Daniels-Attorney-Firm-Failed-to-Make-Back-Tax-Payment-of-440000-Could-Face-Legal-Action-by-the-Federal-Government-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Paperwork-Tax-Paperwork-300x200.png" alt="Stormy Daniels Attorney Firm Failed to Make Back Tax Payment of 440000 Could Face Legal Action by the Federal Government, SFS Tax Problem Solutions, Paperwork, Tax Paperwork" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Stormy-Daniels-Attorney-Firm-Failed-to-Make-Back-Tax-Payment-of-440000-Could-Face-Legal-Action-by-the-Federal-Government-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Paperwork-Tax-Paperwork-300x200.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Stormy-Daniels-Attorney-Firm-Failed-to-Make-Back-Tax-Payment-of-440000-Could-Face-Legal-Action-by-the-Federal-Government-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Paperwork-Tax-Paperwork-700x468.png 700w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Stormy-Daniels-Attorney-Firm-Failed-to-Make-Back-Tax-Payment-of-440000-Could-Face-Legal-Action-by-the-Federal-Government-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Paperwork-Tax-Paperwork.png 762w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<h3><strong>More Troubles for the Firm</strong></h3>
<p>This is in addition to missing a $2 million payment to former partner Jason Frank that was needed for the firm to settle its bankruptcy. Because of the missed payment, a bankruptcy court ordered the firm to pay $10 million on May 22.</p>
<h3><strong>Avenatti Denies His Ties to the Firm </strong></h3>
<p>According to court documents, Michael Avenatti is a “managing member and majority equity stakeholder” of the firm in question, Eagan Avenatti.</p>
<p>In spite of this, Avenatti claims he has no ties to the firm that bears his name.</p>
<p>There is much evidence to the contrary, however.</p>
<p>First, the California State Bar lists him as an attorney with the Eagan Avenatti firm.</p>
<p>Avenatti also sent emails to the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> about the case from Eagan Avenatti’s address and with Eagan Avenatti’s URL at the bottom of his emails.</p>
<p>Not only that, according to the Los-Angeles-based U.S. attorney’s office, Avenatti blamed the failure to remit payroll taxes on a payroll company.</p>
<p>Why would you do that, if you were not a managing partner of the firm?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that question will go unanswered.</p>
<h3><strong>What <em>Not</em> to Do</strong></h3>
<p>If you happen to find yourself in the middle of a legal storm (no pun intended), just remember that claims such as these are very easy to check out.</p>
<p>So be very, very careful about making such blatantly false statements. You will be caught in their web… and it can be much worse than if you simply owned up to the facts.</p>
<p>As always, honesty is the best policy&#8230; closely followed by paying your taxes on time!</p>
<h3><strong>Employers Beware </strong></h3>
<p>When you withhold payroll taxes from employees, you have the responsibility to turn those taxes over to the proper authority.</p>
<p>If you do not, you can face criminal charges, in addition to penalties and interest.</p>
<p>This goes for <em>any</em> taxes a company may owe.</p>
<p>As well, if there is an installment agreement in place with the IRS, you need to abide by that agreement. Make all of your payments on time to avoid further collection action such as tax liens, levies, and even criminal charges.</p>
<h3><strong>Professional Advice Pays Off</strong></h3>
<p>No matter what your financial situation is, you need to address any outstanding issues with the IRS.</p>
<p>A qualified tax professional can help you determine the best course of action for your unique circumstances. They can also analyze your situation to determine how best to lower your tax liability – legally.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The popular “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” TV series made Will Smith a household name. It also got him out of tax trouble with the IRS, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/will-smith-did-fresh-prince-because-he-was-trouble-irs-1111359">according to an article from The Hollywood Reporter</a>.</p>
<p>It was in the late 1980s that Will Smith had his first taste of fame. His smash hit “Parents Just Don’t Understand” with DJ Jazzy Jeff topped the charts.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Smith spent all the money he earned from the song. He also neglected to pay taxes on that money. His second album didn’t fare so well, so his search for income alternatives began.</p>
<p>His girlfriend at the time suggested he might meet someone with influence just by “hanging around” The Arsenio Hall Show Paramount studio.</p>
<p>Turns out, she was right.</p>
<p>Smith found himself brainstorming an idea for the TV show with Quincy Jones, This led to an informal audition with NBC’s Brandon Tartikoff.</p>
<p>And so a TV legend was born!</p>
<h3><strong>Tax Lesson Learned</strong></h3>
<p>Taxes are typically not the first thing on a young man’s mind.</p>
<p>If you work for an employer, that employer (should) already be taking taxes out of your paycheck.</p>
<p>Yet, when you are earning money independently, the entity paying you does not have this responsibility.</p>
<p>They do, however, have to tell the Federal Government what they paid you. This can lead to big tax bills if you aren’t making plans for paying for or withholding taxes yourself.</p>
<p>It’s always better to deal with your taxes in the year you earn them.</p>
<p>That’s why many independent contractors pay quarterly taxes. If they waited until the end of the year, it would be a much bigger check they would have to cut.</p>

<h3><strong>A New Life Awaits You </strong></h3>
<p>Besides the practical implications, there’s another takeaway from Smith’s story.</p>
<p>When faced with a challenge, we can rise above it. We can even have a much better outcome and life than we ever expected.</p>
<p>If Smith hadn’t had the tax trouble, would he have been as motivated to stand outside of Paramount’s studio, waiting for someone influential to walk by?</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>But he did, and it led to his smash hit TV show and to a life of fame afterward. Not to mention an <a href="https://www.therichest.com/celebnetworth/celeb/actors/will-smith-net-worth/">estimated net worth of $260 million</a> today.</p>
<p>You, too, can survive and thrive after tax trouble.</p>
<p>Take the first step by talking with an experienced tax professional. For a complimentary initial consultation, call (772) 337-1040 or set up an appointment online.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even social media giants can have tax trouble.</p>
<p>Facebook’s request to have its $7 billion tax case decided by the IRS Office of Appeals has been denied by a California judge, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2018/05/16/facebook-loses-bid-to-move-7-billion-tax-case-to-appeals/#c5300a47f998">as reported by <em>Forbes</em></a> on May 16.</p>
<p>The IRS Office of Appeals is an independent office that serves as a way to resolve disputes outside of the courts. Facebook has been denied this alternative not once, but twice.</p>
<p>This does not mean that Facebook has lost its case.</p>
<p>Rather, it will see its day in the U.S. Tax Court… currently set for August 21, 2019.</p>
<h3><strong>What’s the Issue? </strong></h3>
<p>In 2010, Facebook shifted rights to its international business assets to Facebook Ireland. (Its United States and Canada business were not included in the transaction).</p>
<p>These assets included its user base, online platform and marketing tangibles.</p>
<p>Ernst &amp; Young assigned a value of $5.8 billion to these assets.</p>
<p>The IRS contends that this value was too low, which led to Facebook paying lower taxes. They maintain the assets were worth $14 billion… more than double Ernst &amp; Young’s valuation.</p>
<p>Based on their findings, the IRS has filed a notice of deficiency for the 2010 tax year. Not only that, the IRS will assess tax based on their valuation to the years <em>after</em> 2010 as well. This could equal a back tax bill of an estimated $5 million, plus penalties and interest, for the social media company.</p>
<p>For its part, Facebook has challenged the assessment by petitioning the court, as is their right… and that’s the matter that will be decided in tax court.</p>

<h3><strong>Facebook Changes its Revenue Reporting</strong></h3>
<p>On December 12, 2017, Facebook announced that it would begin booking advertising revenues in the country in which they were generated. Previously, those advertising revenues were booked with Facebook Ireland.</p>
<p>This followed a similar move in April 2016 involving the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Facebook had been receiving criticism <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-34504474">for paying only £4,327 ($6,643 in US dollars) in corporate taxes in 2014</a> – which was less than what their average UK employee paid in income tax, as reported by the BBC.</p>
<p>Why? Because Facebook was recording those revenues in Ireland, which has a much lower tax rate.</p>
<p>And again… at the time this was perfectly legal.</p>
<p>Under a firestorm of pressure, however, Facebook reversed course and moved its revenue from <img class="size-medium wp-image-1216 alignleft" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Facebook-and-the-7-Billion-Tax-Case-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Technology-Tablet-I-pad-city-background-blue-ideas-300x110.png" alt="Facebook and the $7 Billion Tax Case, SFS Tax Problem Solutions, Technology, Tablet, I-pad, city background, blue ideas" width="300" height="110" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Facebook-and-the-7-Billion-Tax-Case-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Technology-Tablet-I-pad-city-background-blue-ideas-300x110.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Facebook-and-the-7-Billion-Tax-Case-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Technology-Tablet-I-pad-city-background-blue-ideas.png 660w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Ireland to the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Facebook is Not Alone</strong></h3>
<p>In the past, tech giants Apple and Google also moved assets to Ireland in a so-called <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/double-irish-with-a-dutch-sandwich.asp">“double Irish” technique</a>.</p>
<p>Because of these moves, the Europe Union, as well as Australia and the United Kingdom have explored – and in some cases, enacted – new requirements regarding taxing multinational corporations.</p>
<p>For example, Australia and the United Kingdom have a “Google tax.” This is a tax on profits that are moved offshore to countries with lower tax rates.</p>
<p>In July 2017, Reuters reported that the European Parliament passed a resolution that forced multinational corporations to report their tax and financial data by country, in all the nations in which they operate.</p>
<p>For Ireland’s sake, the laws that allowed for multinationals to work the system in a “double Irish” fashion were phased out in 2015. Companies that already had this structure at the time may continue benefiting from it until 2020.</p>

<h3><strong>Don’t Cry for Facebook</strong></h3>
<p>The social media giant is not in any danger of folding, even if the IRS case does not go their way.</p>
<p>Why? Because of their extremely healthy bottom line.</p>
<p>In 2017, the company realized revenues of <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/fb/financials">$40.65 billion</a>. And that’s a 47% increase over 2016.</p>
<p>Of course, it will hurt in the quarter (or over several quarters) that the IRS takes its bite (if it happens). But Facebook has outstanding revenue and net income to take it in stride.</p>
<p>Their 2017 net income – after amortization, depreciation, operating expenses, and taxes, among other line items –is still a cool $15.92 billion, which is a 56% increase over 2016’s $10.19 billion.</p>

<h3><strong>Top 3 Lessons Learned from Facebook’s Tax Trouble</strong></h3>
<p>So what can we – as non-billionaires – learn from all of this?</p>
<p>Here are three essential takeaways from this story.</p>
<h4><strong><em>Lesson #1 – There are always ways to legally reduce your tax bill</em></strong></h4>
<p>At issue with the Facebook case is not whether transferring assets to Ireland was legal. It was, at the time.</p>
<p>Instead, it was the <em>valuation</em> of those assets which is in question.</p>
<p>We’ll just have to see how this plays out.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, whether you have billions of dollars or a hundred, there is a way to (legally) reduce the taxes you owe. A good tax professional can help you find those ways.</p>
<h4><strong><em>Lesson #2 – Tax laws are complex… and ever-changing</em></strong></h4>
<p>When you do find that tax loophole, realize that you may not have it next year.</p>
<p>On the plus side, there may be some new law that can help you save.</p>
<p>For instance, the United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts could be a boon to Facebook, as it slashes the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% in 2018. It also gave companies a break on returning foreign revenue.</p>
<p>So does it make sense for Facebook to make another move to take advantage of this? You can be sure there is a tax expert (or several) somewhere looking at this for them.</p>
<p>You see, there is no “set it and forget it” when it comes to taxes.</p>
<p>It’s a field that never sits still, which (conveniently) takes me to the next lesson…</p>
<h4><strong><em>Lesson #3 – You need a tax professional to help you navigate tax law</em></strong></h4>
<p>We know you are smart… that’s why you’re reading this!</p>
<p>The thing is, with everything you have to do (otherwise known as your life), do you really want to learn all of the nearly 80,000 pages of tax code and case law?</p>
<p>If you do, hats off to you!</p>
<p>By the way, that tax code is changed and added to all the time (see lesson #2).</p>
<p>Why waste the time and energy, and possibly make a mistake?</p>
<p>Paying a tax professional pays off in tax savings (and time, money and possible trouble with the IRS).</p>
<p>This goes double for those of you with tax troubles.</p>
<p>Don’t go it alone… seek out expert tax advice!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The IRS is not your Friend. Caution Needed. An SFS Tax Problem Solutions Blog. </em></p>
<p>Recently a man called my office who hadn’t filed taxes in over a decade. He said he wanted to go to his local IRS office and get transcripts of his 1099s and then go to a tax preparer. My staff advised him against it, but he insisted.</p>
<p>This is not a good idea.</p>
<p>It’s like going to the judge to admit you’ve done a crime, and then seeking an attorney to represent you. You should seek advice first; then act.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the man wouldn’t agree to a free consultation with me first. I could have saved him a lot of aggravation.</p>
<p>So for all of you out there who think this sounds reasonable, please listen up:</p>
<h3><strong>The IRS is Not Your Friend</strong></h3>
<p>The IRS has a job to do – collect revenue.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that they won’t treat you with courtesy.</p>
<p>It’s just that their main goal is different than yours.</p>
<p>Hey, it’s great that after more than a decade this man decided to come clean. The only problem is that he could be costing himself thousands of dollars. You need to approach these situations in the right way.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean that you treat them with disdain. The end goal is to get right with the IRS, which is an attitude that will serve you well as you go through the process.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-1122 alignright" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-IRS-is-not-your-friend-Caution-Needed-SFS-Tax-Game-of-Chess-300x201.png" alt="The IRS is not your friend, Caution Needed, SFS Tax, Game of Chess" width="376" height="252" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-IRS-is-not-your-friend-Caution-Needed-SFS-Tax-Game-of-Chess-300x201.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-IRS-is-not-your-friend-Caution-Needed-SFS-Tax-Game-of-Chess-768x514.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-IRS-is-not-your-friend-Caution-Needed-SFS-Tax-Game-of-Chess-1024x685.png 1024w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-IRS-is-not-your-friend-Caution-Needed-SFS-Tax-Game-of-Chess-700x468.png 700w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-IRS-is-not-your-friend-Caution-Needed-SFS-Tax-Game-of-Chess.png 1028w" sizes="(max-width: 376px) 100vw, 376px" />It’s like playing a game of chess. You have to know the rules and how to play it, or you’ll be off the board in no time.</p>
<p>There are no cut-and-dried answers here. Someone with experience and knowledge needs to assess your situation and provide advice.</p>
<p>Here are some little-known facts about the IRS and their collection activities.</p>
<h3><strong>The IRS only has 10 Years to Collect… from When the Return is Filed </strong></h3>
<p>So all the years prior to that? He doesn’t need to worry about them. There are some exceptions to this rule, however, as there are to almost every tax rule.</p>
<p>If you did not file a return (as the man who called my office did not), the IRS can create one for you based on the information they have. If you owe tax, they can make a deficiency assessment.</p>
<p>Guess what? The ten-year period starts at the time the return is filed – not ten years ago when you actually earned the money or when the return was originally due.</p>
<p>So maybe it’s not a good idea to alert them to the fact that you didn’t file and may owe money?</p>
<h3><strong>The IRS can make a Mistake</strong></h3>
<p>Believe it or not, the IRS is staffed with humans just like you and me. They can make mistakes.</p>
<p>That’s why you need experienced tax representation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.naea.org/educating-america/becoming-enrolled-agent-faqs">Enrolled Agents</a> have either worked for the IRS or they’ve gone through rigorous testing and continuing education to become one. An Enrolled Agent will scour your records to make sure that you actually owe what the IRS says you owe.</p>
<p>I’ve seen errors in expense calculations for small businesses, for example. Leave out an expense that is large enough and your tax debt goes up significantly. If you forget to include an IRA contribution, your tax bill can increase.</p>
<p>As another example, many people think that all 1099s should be reported as income. This is not always the case. Distributions from college savings plan covering qualifying education costs should not be counted as income. Even if you didn’t use the money for school, the taxes due are only on the earnings. The after-tax dollars you used to fund the account in the first place do not count.</p>
<h3><strong>You May Not Owe Anything</strong></h3>
<p>You won’t get in trouble for not filing your taxes. You will get in trouble for not <em>paying</em> them.</p>
<p>If you don’t owe anything, all will be fine. You may even get a refund.</p>
<p>Once again, I would recommend going to a knowledgeable Enrolled Agent. An EAs main goal is to reduce your tax burden or maximize your refund.</p>
<p>The IRS has no interest in paying out refunds to non-filers. They stay focused on getting revenue in the door.</p>
<p>Of course, you only have three years to claim a refund so that provides another incentive to act fast.</p>
<p>In every case, you have nothing to lose by seeking an Enrolled Agent’s advice. At SFS Tax Problem Solutions, we happen to offer free consultations. Take advantage of that before going to the IRS.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Debt can be a dark cloud that hangs over everything you do. When it comes to taxes, it’s that much worse. The more you ignore a tax debt, the bigger the debt gets, as penalties and interest are added on. Not only that, the IRS has the power to assess <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_lien">tax liens</a> against your personal property and even levy your bank account or garnish your wages.</p>
<p>If this is you… take heart!</p>
<h3><strong>You Can Make a Fresh Start </strong></h3>
<p>The IRS has a Fresh Start program that launched 10 years ago in the midst of a biting economic recession. Designed to make paying your back taxes and avoiding tax liens easier, it has been expanded over the years. The program has helped people around the country get back on their feet.</p>
<p>Knowing exactly where you stand makes it easier to come to a resolution that will satisfy the IRS and allow you to move on with your life…minus one dark cloud. We recommend retaining a professional in dealing with these issues.</p>
<h3><strong>Greater Access to Installment Agreements </strong></h3>
<p>Sometimes you can’t pay what you owe all at once. The IRS offers installment agreements for this purpose.</p>
<p>What if you can’t pay the monthly amount the IRS wants?</p>
<p>Don’t despair.</p>
<p>There are options.</p>
<h3><strong>IRS Tax Liens Minimum Raised</strong></h3>
<p>The program increased to $10,000 the amount you must owe before a tax lien can be filed. The IRS may still file a tax lien notice for an amount less than the $10,000 at its discretion, however.</p>
<p>One important feature of the Fresh Start program is that the tax lien may be withdrawn if you meet certain conditions, including paying off your tax debt.  You may also qualify if you are paying your debt through a Direct Debit installment agreement.</p>
<p>However, if you then default on your installment agreement the IRS can file another tax lien.</p>
<h3><strong>Greater Flexibility when Considering Offers in Compromise</strong></h3>
<p>The IRS will analyze your ability to pay when considering whether to agree to allow you to settle your tax debt for less than the full amount. The Fresh Start program gave the IRS more flexibility when analyzing that ability.</p>
<p>If they believe you can pay in full within a reasonable amount of time, it will probably not be accepted. The IRS looks at your income, assets, and other factors in determining your ability to pay.</p>
<p>Did we make it sound easy? It’s not. It’s a lot of work and it takes time for the taxpayer and their representative. Don’t do this alone.</p>
