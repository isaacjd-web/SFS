								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Back Taxes Keeps This Candidate from Running for Office (and Other Ways Back Taxes Can Affect You). An SFS Tax Problem Solutions Blog. </em></p>
<p>Kevin James (R) is still listed on the ballot in an East Cobb, Georgia primary race today. However, he will not win, no matter how many votes he receives – all because of back taxes.</p>
<p>James was challenging current Republican State Representative Sharon Cooper for her seat in the state’s House District 43. The primary race featured just the two candidates.</p>
<p>On Friday, May 18, however, the Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp disqualified James from the race.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-1180 alignright" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Back-Taxes-Keep-Candidate-from-Running-for-Office-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-US-Flag-United-States-Flag-300x199.png" alt="Back Taxes Keep Candidate from Running for Office, SFS Tax Problem Solutions, US Flag, United States Flag" width="300" height="199" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Back-Taxes-Keep-Candidate-from-Running-for-Office-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-US-Flag-United-States-Flag-300x199.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Back-Taxes-Keep-Candidate-from-Running-for-Office-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-US-Flag-United-States-Flag.png 661w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />According to Georgia’s constitution, candidates with outstanding back taxes that do not have an agreement for a payment plan cannot hold or run for office.</p>
<p>In this case, there was more than one instance of delinquent federal and state taxes owed by James, dating back to 2006. He also was the subject of tax liens.</p>
<p>With her primary election fate assured, Cooper will now be facing the democratic candidate in the general election on November 6.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, back taxes can be a dark cloud over you that casts its shadow on all you do.</p>
<p>Besides preventing you from running for office, here are other ways back taxes can creep into your life:</p>
<h2><img class="size-medium wp-image-1177 alignleft" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Back-Taxes-Keep-Candidate-from-Running-for-Office-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Getting-a-Job-300x126.png" alt="Back Taxes Keep Candidate from Running for Office, SFS Tax Problem Solutions, Getting a Job" width="300" height="126" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Back-Taxes-Keep-Candidate-from-Running-for-Office-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Getting-a-Job-300x126.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Back-Taxes-Keep-Candidate-from-Running-for-Office-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Getting-a-Job-768x323.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Back-Taxes-Keep-Candidate-from-Running-for-Office-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Getting-a-Job-700x294.png 700w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Back-Taxes-Keep-Candidate-from-Running-for-Office-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Getting-a-Job.png 969w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Back taxes can keep you from being employed</h2>
<p>When back taxes are not addressed, they can eventually show up as a tax lien. Tax liens are filed against your social security number. If your employer does a background investigation or a credit check, the tax lien will show up. It’s the employer call as to whether to offer you the job or not after they receive this information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Again, if a tax lien has been filed, your tax debt is on your credit report for all to see whenever you go to buy something. It will lower your credit score and could prevent you from purchasing a vehicle or your next home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Back taxes won’t stop the sale of your house, however, those back taxes will have first priority on receiving any profits from the sale.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If tax liens don’t do the job, the IRS can seize your assets. This is called a tax levy. They can seize the money you have in your checking and savings account. They can even seize some of the money your employer puts in your paycheck.</p>
<p>As you can see, it’s a very good idea to deal with your back tax issues – as soon as possible. Your situation can get progressively worse. With payment plans, offers in compromise and other avenues available to you, there’s really no reason <em>not</em> to face the consequences. You can get right with the IRS without experiencing tax liens and levies.</p>
