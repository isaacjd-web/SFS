			<p>Of all the creditors or companies, you might owe money to, the Internal Revenue Service can be the least forgiving about debt. If you don&#8217;t pay your taxes, the IRS will levy and take possession of your property, including cash accounts, wages, and real and personal property. The IRS will sell non-liquid assets to raise funds to satisfy the debt you owe.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If you&#8217;ve received a levy notice from the IRS, it&#8217;s time to ACT IMMEDIATELY. Our firm may be able to get your levy released the same day, but you must call now for a confidential consultation. 877-355-8010 or   <a href="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/contact-us-at-sfs-tax-problem-solutions-in-stuart/">https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/contact-us-at-sfs-tax-problem-solutions-in-stuart/</a></span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Unless you don&#8217;t open your mail or you moved without leaving a forwarding address, you probably won&#8217;t be blindsided by an IRS levy. You&#8217;ll receive a &#8220;Notice and Demand for Payment&#8221; of your tax debt well in advance of any action taken. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If you ignore this notice, the IRS will follow up by sending you a &#8220;Final Notice of Intent to Levy and Notice of Your Rights to a Hearing.&#8221; Now the clock begins ticking. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">You have 30 days to pay your tax debt or to contact the IRS to try to stop the levy. Even if you&#8217;re unaware of the levy proceedings, your employer has a little bit of time to warn you if he receives notice that the IRS plans to take the bulk (which can be up to 90%) of your paychecks. Your employer doesn&#8217;t have to begin sending your earnings to the IRS until the next pay period. With any luck, your employer will let you know what&#8217;s going on within this time frame so that you can take action. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If the IRS levies your bank account, the bank will freeze the money in the account and remit it to the IRS after 21 days. Therefore, you must act quickly to try to have the funds released upon receiving a notice that the IRS has levied your bank account. </span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Contact A Tax Relief Firm</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Now is not the time to do it alone. If you call the IRS, they will often trick you into giving incriminating answers, further distancing you for the tax relief you so desperately need. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The IRS is NOT your friend. They are there to collect what they believe you owe in taxes. Contact a professional experienced in tax resolution to help you with your case. Would you go to court without a lawyer? Well, it&#8217;s the same with the IRS. You need professional representation from an Enrolled Agent, CPA, or tax attorney who is also a tax resolution specialist.</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Establish Hardship </span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If the IRS intends to levy your paycheck or Social Security benefits and you can&#8217;t come close to making ends meet on what&#8217;s left, the IRS wants you to contact them. The contact phone number should appear on the levy notice. DO NOT CALL THE IRS.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The law requires that the IRS leave you with the total of your tax exemptions for the year plus your standard deduction divided by 52 if you&#8217;re paid weekly. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Gather your documents and call us. We&#8217;ll help make the case to the IRS and explain that the levy will cause hardship for you and your family. You&#8217;ll have to provide documented evidence of this, but if you do, the IRS will release the levy. This doesn&#8217;t mean you no longer owe the tax. It just means that the IRS will leave your earnings and income alone and work with you to figure out some other way for you to satisfy the debt. </span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Make Payment Arrangements </span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">We can also ask for payment terms for your tax debt even if the levy won&#8217;t cripple you financially. If you enter into an installment agreement, the IRS will typically release the levy unless the notice you received specifically states otherwise. </span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">You Can &#8220;Settle&#8221; For Less Than You Owe</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">An offer in compromise allows you to settle your tax debt for less than the full amount you owe. It may be a legitimate option if you can&#8217;t pay your full tax liability or doing so creates a financial hardship. The IRS considers your unique set of facts and circumstances:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Ability to pay;</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Income;</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Expenses; and</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Asset equity.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The IRS will generally approve an offer in compromise when the amount offered represents the most they can expect to collect within a reasonable period of time. It&#8217;s best to explore all other payment options before submitting an offer in compromise as the Offer in Compromise program is not for everyone. Make sure you hire a tax professional to help you file an offer and be sure to check his or her qualifications.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The IRS doesn&#8217;t want to destroy you financially. They just want the money they are owed. If you can make an arrangement to pay or prove that you don&#8217;t owe the tax, or if you legitimately cannot pay it at this time, you may be able to make the levy go away. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Our firm specializes in tax resolution, even if you have years of unfiled tax returns, we can help! If you want a Certified Tax Resolution Specialist who knows how to navigate the IRS maze, reach out to our firm and we&#8217;ll schedule a no-obligation confidential consultation to explain your options to permanently resolve your tax problem. <a href="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/contact-us-at-sfs-tax-problem-solutions-in-stuart/">https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/contact-us-at-sfs-tax-problem-solutions-in-stuart/ </a></span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="text-align: left;">What Do I Do? I Didn’t Report My Crypto Trades On Prior Year&#8217;s Tax Return?</h5>
<p>In 2014 the IRS determined that cryptocurrency was property for tax purposes. There are well-established rules for how to treat property in place. However, many people aren&#8217;t disclosing their cryptocurrency transactions. If you were buying and selling cryptocurrency at any point in the past few years, you needed to report these transactions on your annual tax return.</p>
<p>The IRS has ramped up its efforts to go after those that did not correctly report their cryptocurrency-trading on prior years&#8217; tax returns.</p>
<p>Back in the summer of 2019, the IRS mailed some 10,000 letters to crypto account owners to educate crypto account holders about the rules.  And tell taxpayers to review their tax reporting for crypto transactions to be sure they reported income correctly.</p>
<p>Forbes published an article on July 31, 2019, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2019/07/31/watch-out-cryptocurrency-owners-the-irs-is-on-the-hunt/#3d2e522d6990">Watch Out Cryptocurrency Owners, The IRS Is On The Hunt.</a> The article explained the letters traders received from the IRS. It stated that &#8220;The IRS might know there is unreported income based on tax information obtained through enforcement actions, which include the summons against U.S. Coinbase customers. You received the letter because you didn&#8217;t file a tax return, which should have included virtual currency transactions. Alternatively, you filed a return but did not report virtual currency transactions. You must reply to this tax notice by submitting a correct late tax return or an amended return.&#8221; They further went on to state that &#8220;Letter 6173 is a severe tax notice, and you should not dig yourself into a bigger hole with an incorrect reply. In some cases, perjury could be a felony. The letter states, &#8220;If we don&#8217;t hear from you by the &#8220;respond by&#8221; date, we may refer your tax account for examination.&#8221;</p>
<p>The IRS advised, “Taxpayers who do not properly report the income tax consequences of virtual currency transactions are, when appropriate, liable for tax, penalties, and interest. In some cases, taxpayers could be subject to criminal prosecution.”</p>
<p>On October 6, the IRS released a ruling with guidance for cryptocurrency holders. They also sent out correspondences advising virtual currency owners to pay their back taxes. If you received a letter from the IRS, you should consult with me immediately.</p>
<p>I am an Advanced Crypto Tax Expert (ACT-E) and specially trained to help taxpayers resolve any outstanding issue to your incorrectly filed tax returns.  <img class="alignright wp-image-2533" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ACT-E-designation-1-300x257.png" alt="Advanced Crypto Expert designation" width="256" height="219" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ACT-E-designation-1-300x257.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ACT-E-designation-1.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px" /></p>
<h5 style="text-align: left;">I didn’t report my crypto trades on my prior year&#8217;s tax return? What do I do?</h5>
<p style="text-align: left;">Did you know that the IRS can go back up to three years to prosecute cases of tax evasion, and in cases where they find significant errors, they can go back up to six years or more? Many crypto investors and traders are concerned about getting audited and having a future tax liability that they can’t afford. The solution to this potential problem is to be proactive and amend your previous years’ return.</p>
<p>What should you do if you already filed your tax return and didn’t report your cryptocurrency gains on that return? Amend your tax return for whichever year(s) you didn’t report your crypto trades. You have three years from the date that you filed your return to file an amended return. The IRS is more forgiving to those who make a good-faith effort to pay their taxes.</p>
<p>To accurately calculate how much money you owe in capital gains, you have to know what the Fair Market Value of the cryptocurrency was at the time of the trade. For traders who have executed hundreds, if not thousands of trades over the years, this can be a daunting task.</p>
<p>As an ACT-E, I have the specific expertise to help taxpayers who didn’t report all of their crypto gains get back on track. We can amend both federal and state income tax returns to report missing crypto gains or other income.</p>
<p>However,  the past three years of tax returns should be amended, but depending on the exact circumstances, a more extended period might be necessary. I can help you assess your current situation and determine how many years you need to amend. Call me today at 877.355.8010 or contact us today, <a href="http://bit.ly/2Hh7cEl.">http://bit.ly/2Hh7cEl.</a></p>

			<h4>F is for First Time Penalty Abatement</h4>
<ul>
<li>The first time penalty abatement (FTA) waiver is an administrative waiver that the IRS may grant to relieve taxpayers from failure-to-file, failure-to-pay and failure-to-deposit penalties if certain criteria are met.</li>
<li>The IRS also removes interest related to those penalties.</li>
</ul>
<p>First Time Penalty Abatement is an option that may be available to taxpayers to remove IRS penalties that have been assessed to a tax debt. However, not everyone qualifies for penalty abatement. Also, not all penalties are eligible for penalty abatement. Some of the most common penalties that are able to be abated are failure to file, failure to pay, and failure to deposit estimated tax.</p>
<h5>You may qualify for administrative relief from penalties for failing to file a tax return, pay on time, and/or to deposit taxes when due under the IRS First Time Penalty Abatement policy if you meet the following:</h5>
<ul>
<li>A taxpayer didn’t previously have to file a return, or you have no penalties for the 3 tax years prior to the tax year in which you received a penalty.</li>
<li>You filed all currently required returns or filed an extension of time to file.</li>
<li>You have paid, or arranged to pay, any tax due.</li>
</ul>
<p>The failure-to-pay penalty will continue to accrue, until the tax is paid in full. It may be to your advantage to wait until you fully pay the tax due prior to requesting penalty relief under the Service&#8217;s first-time penalty abatement policy. The penalty is 5% of your balance per month.</p>
<p>Interest charged on a penalty will be reduced or removed when that penalty is reduced or removed. If an unpaid balance remains on your account, interest will continue to accrue until the account is full paid.</p>
<p>Other administrative relief: If you received incorrect oral advice from the IRS, you may qualify for administrative relief.</p>
<p>Determining whether a situation or event qualifies a taxpayer for penalty relief can be tricky. Seeking professional help from an Enrolled Agent and Certified Tax Resolution Specialist is helpful not only because the tax professional is familiar with the qualifications for penalty abatement, but also, they will know how to properly organize and submit your request.  Discover how to solve your tax problem by speaking with us today. <a href="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/media/"> Find out more about me</a>.

			<h4>2020, The Year You Deal With Your Back Taxes!</h4>
<p>Deal With Your Back Taxes. According to the IRS, more than 13.2 million Americans owe back taxes. The majority of these cases involve amounts that seem impossible to pay off.</p>
<p>That leaves those tax-owing folks in a difficult position. They want to pay, but they can&#8217;t, and the end result is feeling a lot of guilt about the situation.  There is no easy way to get out of paying your back taxes. Uncle Sam wants his money, and he&#8217;ll get it somehow.</p>
<p>There are steps you can take to find a solution and make 2020 the year you finally deal with your taxes.</p>
<p>Note, we always recommend getting in touch with a Certified Tax Resolution Specialist to negotiate with the IRS on your behalf. If you’d like to schedule a no-cost confidential tax relief consultation, contact us here. <a href="https://meetme.so/SFSTax"><strong>https://meetme.so/SFSTax</strong></a> or call 877.355.8010</p>
<h4><strong>Why Now Is the Right Time to Deal with Back Taxes</strong><strong><img class="alignright wp-image-4308" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Now-Is-the-Right-Time-to-Deal-with-Back-Taxes-1-300x158.png" alt="Deal With Your Back Taxes-finances-hpuse-sfstaxproblemsolutions" width="372" height="196" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Now-Is-the-Right-Time-to-Deal-with-Back-Taxes-1-300x158.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Now-Is-the-Right-Time-to-Deal-with-Back-Taxes-1-768x404.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Now-Is-the-Right-Time-to-Deal-with-Back-Taxes-1.png 1000w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Now-Is-the-Right-Time-to-Deal-with-Back-Taxes-1-700x368.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 372px) 100vw, 372px" /></strong></h4>
<p><strong>#1 You&#8217;ll End Up Owing Less</strong></p>
<p>The longer you wait to pay your back taxes, the more you are going to end up owing. That&#8217;s because the IRS can and will add penalties that can add up quickly.   The longer you drag out the situation, the more you&#8217;ll need to pay your tax resolution specialist to help you handle everything. The sooner you act, the sooner you can resolve the issue and the less you&#8217;ll have to pay.</p>
<p>If you need help from a CPA, Enrolled Agent or a lawyer who is also a tax resolution professional, look for someone that will charge you a flat fee rather than an hourly rate. Some cases take longer to resolve, so it’s important to know up front what you’ll be paying in service fees to get your back-tax issue resolved.</p>
<p><strong>#2 Housing prices are at an all-time high. Time to cash in?</strong></p>
<p>If you own your home or have equity in it, selling it and downsizing may be the best way to settle your tax debt and get a clean slate. Now is a perfect time, too, with housing prices at a premium in many areas of the country. You can use that cash in the bank to settle your back taxes almost immediately. Additionally, if your home is worth more than you owe, you can then reinvest that money or save it for a rainy day. That gives you a clean financial slate to start rebuilding your life.</p>
<p><strong>#3 Economic Uncertainty</strong></p>
<p>Most experts agree we’re due for a recession soon. How soon? Well, no one knows. What we do know is that having a large back tax bill will only hinder your ability to weather a storm in the event of an economic downturn.</p>
<p>You might be able to take a low interest loan out now that the economy is still good and settle your tax bill. Taking care of your taxes while the economy is still good will give you peace of mind and breathing room in case things go south with the economy.</p>

			<h4><strong>The Tax Resolution Alphabet &#8211; D is for Debt Relief</strong></h4>
<p>If you are struggling with IRS tax debt and feel like it’s a hopeless situation, it may not be as  awful as you think. The IRS Fresh Start Program was created to make it easier and more accessible for people to repay or settle their tax debt.</p>
<p>Taxes often seem overwhelming and overly complex, almost like a project that you didn’t research and were unable to complete.</p>
<h5><strong>About the Fresh Start Program</strong></h5>
<p>The IRS initiated its Fresh Start Program in 2008 and expanded it in 2012 to ease the financial burdens of taxpayers who owe up to $50,000 in taxes. It is available to both business owners and individual taxpayers</p>
<p>The program is designed to allow taxpayers to pay off substantial tax debts affordably over the course of six years. Each month, taxpayers make payments that are based on their current income and the value of their liquid assets.</p>
<p>It simplifies the process of paying back large tax debts. It also helps people avoid many of the damages of owing a tax debt to the IRS including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accrued Interest</li>
<li>Recurring Penalties</li>
<li>Tax liens</li>
<li>Seizure of assets</li>
<li>Wage garnishments</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong> Qualifies for the Fresh Start Program?</strong></h5>
<p>In order to qualify for the IRS Fresh Start Program for debt settlement or lien withdrawals, generally you&#8217;ll need a couple of things at a minimum:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any missing or unfiled tax returns must be filed.</li>
<li>You are current with your estimated tax payments or your current withholdings are correct, and they have been so for the last 6 months.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Can the IRS ReallyTake My Money and Assets?</h5>
<p>The IRS and Department of Treasury can really take your money and possessions. There are ways to combat these aggressive tactics. Learn more by reading my book, Now What?

			<p style="text-align: left;">C is for the <em>Currently Not Collectible</em><em> </em><em>Status </em>from the IRS</p>
<p>Big companies are known for getting all sorts of breaks, but when average people fall behind, they rarely receive help. When you owe back taxes, but can’t afford to pay them, then you may qualify for a special tax status known as <em>currently not collectible</em>.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-4118 alignleft" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/C-is-for-currently-not-collectible-300x158.png" alt="" width="391" height="206" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/C-is-for-currently-not-collectible-300x158.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/C-is-for-currently-not-collectible-768x404.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/C-is-for-currently-not-collectible.png 1000w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/C-is-for-currently-not-collectible-700x368.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 391px) 100vw, 391px" /></p>
<p>If you’re IRS approved for currently not collectible status, they must not only cease its collection efforts, but they can no longer garnish your wages or seize your property.</p>
<p>Want to know if you qualify for currently not collectible status? Contact our firm here for a specific evaluation of your situation. <em>Visit our website, <a href="http://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/">sfstaxproblemsolutions.com</a> to book your <strong>Free Debt Settlement Analysis</strong> at </em><a href="https://go.oncehub.com/jeffreyschneider"><strong>https://go.oncehub.com/jeffreyschneider</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>What is Currently Not Collectible Status? </strong></p>
<p>If the IRS agrees that you can’t pay your back taxes and cover your reasonable living expenses, they may place your account in the Currently Not Collectible status.  This determination is based on your <img class="alignright wp-image-4111" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-300x300.png" alt="warning sign, do not try this alone" width="269" height="269" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-300x300.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-150x150.png 150w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-768x768.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-570x570.png 570w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-500x500.png 500w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-1000x1000.png 1000w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS-700x700.png 700w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warning-Do-Not-Try-This-Alone-SFS.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 269px) 100vw, 269px" />current financial situation.</p>
<p>You can request currently not collectible status by submitting the proper form and proof to the IRS of your income and expenses, as well as whether you can sell any assets you may have or get a loan.</p>
<p>As you’ll need to be able to document your inability to pay, be sure to gather copies of all your bills, your most recent paycheck stubs, and statements detailing other sources of income such as alimony, pensions or investments. If the IRS determines that your necessary expenses exceed your income, then it will notify you of your Currently Not Collectable status.</p>
<p>WARNING: Don’t try to do this alone. We recommend reaching out to our tax resolution firm to guide you through your options. Talking to the IRS directly could be like shooting yourself in the foot. They’ll ask you very invasive questions that could land you in deeper trouble. Remember, the IRS is not your friend. Their job is to collect what they believe you owe them, so it’s best to have a professional in your corner.</p>
<p><strong>Not a Permanent Solution</strong></p>
<p>Keep in mind that currently not collectible status applies only to your back taxes. You will still have to file tax returns, and you will not be exempted from paying current and future taxes. You will also continue to accumulate penalties and interest on your unpaid taxes. After a year or two, the IRS may review your status, and if you’re able to begin paying your back taxes, then you must do so. If you’re still not able to pay, then your status will be renewed.</p>
<p><strong>Statute of Limitations   </strong></p>
<p>The IRS can attempt to collect outstanding taxes for only ten years from the date the taxes were assessed against you; usually, that’s the date you filed. If at the end of this 10-year period the IRS hasn’t collected, then the taxes are no longer owed.</p>
<p>In difficult times, many families have trouble meeting their commitments. If you’re worried about the IRS garnishing your wages, levying your bank account, or taking your home, then reaching out to our firm and getting a free, no-obligation, confidential consultation on your tax problem may give you some peace of mind. If you’re not approved for Currently Not Collectible status, our firm will explain the many other tax relief options with you.

			<p><strong>Owe Money to the IRS? It&#8217;s Called Back Taxes</strong></p>
<p>Back taxes refer to taxes owed from a prior year.</p>
<p>A taxpayer may be behind in paying taxes for intentional or negligent reasons. Some of these reasons include – filing a return and failing to pay the tax liability; failing to report all income earned during the tax year, and; neglecting to file a tax return for a given tax year.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-4126 alignleft" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Do-you-suffer-from-FOF_Fear-of-Filing-300x300.png" alt="" width="211" height="211" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Do-you-suffer-from-FOF_Fear-of-Filing-300x300.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Do-you-suffer-from-FOF_Fear-of-Filing-150x150.png 150w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Do-you-suffer-from-FOF_Fear-of-Filing-768x768.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Do-you-suffer-from-FOF_Fear-of-Filing-570x570.png 570w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Do-you-suffer-from-FOF_Fear-of-Filing-500x500.png 500w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Do-you-suffer-from-FOF_Fear-of-Filing-700x700.png 700w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Do-you-suffer-from-FOF_Fear-of-Filing.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 211px) 100vw, 211px" /></p>
<p>If taxes remain unpaid after multiple notices have been sent by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), a minimum penalty fee of $135 will be charged in addition to interest on the unpaid amount, which is 0.5% per month that the taxpayer is late, up to 25%. As the total tax debt increases each month due to penalty and interest, over time, it can grow into a significant amount.</p>

We can file all of your deinquent returns and help you with the penalties and interest.  Contact our firm here for an evaluation of your situation. <em>Visit our website, <a href="http://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/">sfstaxproblemsolutions.com</a> to book your <strong>Free Debt Settlement Analysis</strong> at </em><a href="https://go.oncehub.com/jeffreyschneider"><strong>https://go.oncehub.com/jeffreyschneider.</strong></a></p>
<p>Unpaid back taxes can be a serious issue for many taxpayers who don&#8217;t have the means to pay them. Depending upon the circumstances, the government may take one of many strategies to deal with back taxes, such as pressing charges, demanding that that the taxpayer pay immediately, or sometimes offering a voluntary disclosure program which helps avoid criminal charges and allows a variety of payment options. Failure to pay taxes can also involve imprisonment.</p>
<p>In some cases, the IRS will seize property, seize assets, or place liens on property. The IRS may place a federal tax lien to inform other creditors of the taxing authorities legal right to a taxpayer’s assets and property. The IRS also has the power to garnish a taxpayer’s wages and to levy their financial accounts, seizing up to the total amount of taxes owed. If the taxes remain unpaid, the tax authority can use a tax levy to legally seize the taxpayer&#8217;s assets (such as bank accounts, investment accounts, automobiles, and real property) in order to collect the money, it is owed. While a lien secures the government’s interest or claim in an individual’s or business’ property when the tax debt remains unpaid, a levy actually permits the government to seize and sell the property in order to pay the tax debt.</p>

			<p>IRS Appeals</p>
<p>An unexpected envelope from the Internal Revenue Service is never a good thing.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s never pleasant, but any letter that you receive should not be ignored, especially if you disagree with an IRS decision.</p>
<p>In fact, the IRS Taxpayer Bill of Rights covers this specific situation as one of a taxpayer&#8217;s rights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay no more than the correct amount of tax,</li>
<li>Challenge the IRS&#8217; position and be heard and</li>
<li>Appeal an IRS decision in an independent forum</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some tips on getting through an IRS disagreement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get professional help: First, if you don&#8217;t have a tax professional, get one.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if your disputed tax situation is not that complicated, dealing with the IRS can be difficult. A tax professional that has standing with the IRS, like an Enrolled Agent (EA), CPA, or attorney with experience in resolving issues between the IRS and taxpayers can save you time, and money. A Certified Tax Resolution Specialist (CTRS) is specially trained to argue your case before the IRS.</p>
<ul>
<li>Know the general appeals process: Your tax pro will help you understand what to expect and what happens during your appeal process.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Appeals Office is separate from and independent of the IRS office that took action against you. It&#8217;s also the only level of administrative appeal within the IRS.</p>
<p>Conferences with an Appeals Office representative can be held informally by correspondence, telephone, or at a face-to-face meeting.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to have official representation at an appeals conference, but as noted at the beginning of this post, it&#8217;s generally a good idea.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4156" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IRS-letter-300x251.png" alt="IRS letter-sfs tax problem solutions" width="300" height="251" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IRS-letter-300x251.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IRS-letter-768x644.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IRS-letter-700x587.png 700w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IRS-letter.png 940w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Preparation is essential: If you do go to the Appeals Office, be prepared to discuss all issues you don&#8217;t agree with at the conference.</p>
<p>You also might need to file a formal written protest or a small case request with the office named in the IRS letter you received.</p>
<p>And definitely be sure to file your protest within the time limit specified in the letter you received.</p>
<p>Specifically, Appeals isn&#8217;t interested in and won&#8217;t accept any objection you have based on moral, religious, political, constitutional, conscientious, or similar grounds.</p>
<ul>
<li>Let the pros handle it: Your tax adviser can file the written protest for you.</li>
</ul>
<p>He or she also can take care of the discussions or hearings without you if you decide you just don&#8217;t want to go it alone.</p>
<p>If you do opt to skip the Appeal Office meeting and send only your lawyer, CPA or EA to make your case, be sure you have completed a power of attorney form allowing your representative to receive and inspect confidential information.</p>
<ul>
<li>Beyond Appeals: The IRS says that going through the Office of Appeals process generally settles most tax disputes without expensive and time-consuming court trials.</li>
</ul>
<p>If, however, that&#8217;s not the case in your tax disagreement, you can take your protest to the judicial level. This includes appeals to the United States Tax Court, the United States Court of Federal Claims or your United States District Court.</p>
<p>In difficult times, many families have trouble meeting their commitments. If you’re worried about the IRS garnishing your wages, levying your bank account, or taking your home,</p>
