Schneider and How is He Qualified to Navigate the Murky Tax Seas?</strong></h1>
<p>The idea of receiving a letter from the IRS is not a pleasant one for anyone. What makes it worse is the confusion, the fear, the assumptions and the thoughts of all the worst-case scenarios that can make you feel like you have a tidal wave of stress.</p>
<h2><strong><img class="wp-image-3670 alignright" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Now-What-The-IRS-is-Taking-Everything-I-Own-Help-Florida-Treasure-Coast-Beachline-1.jpg" alt="Now What The IRS is Taking Everything I Own Help, Florida, Treasure Coast, Beachline" width="353" height="288" /></strong></h2>
<p>Chapter 1 of <em>Now What? The IRS is Taking Everything I Own. Help! </em>focuses on exactly <strong>who</strong> Jeff is, and <strong>why</strong> he is great with taxpayers like yourself.</p>
<h2><strong>An EA is the only federally licensed tax professional. </strong></h2>
<p>For over 35 years, Jeffrey Schneider EA, CTRS, NTPIF has been helping taxpayers like you:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/tax-relief-services/tax-preparation-services/">File tax returns</a></li>
<li><a href="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/tax-relief-services/irs-letters-and-notices/">Respond to IRS notices</a></li>

</ul>
<h2><strong>Location </strong></h2>
<p>His practice is located on Florida’s Treasure Coast with a satellite office in Palm Beach. Jeff represents clients all over the country… because again, an Enrolled Agent is the <em>only </em>federally licensed tax pro!</p>
<h2><strong>What do the Other Credentials Mean? <img class="alignright wp-image-3669 " src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Book-2-Chapter-1-Meme-1.jpg" alt="" width="391" height="393" /></strong></h2>
<p>In 2010, Jeff became a fellow of the National Tax Practice Institute. This program focuses solely on the many facets of representing taxpayers, individuals, and businesses before the IRS.</p>
<p>In 2015, he passed an advanced exam offered by the American Society of Tax Problem Solvers (ASTPS) to become a Certified Tax Resolution Specialist (CTRS).</p>
<p>Jeffrey A. Schneider EA, CTRS, NTPIF, ACT-E has earned the designation of Advanced Crypto Tax- Expert (ACT-E) from the Academy of Crypto Tax. He can help you or anyone you know (even if they are into “mining”) deal with the complicated tax implication of the Crypto World.</p>
<p>He recently had the honor of being selected to serve a three-year term on the Internal Revenue Service Advisory Council (IRSAC). The purpose of this council is to make recommendations to the Internal Revenue Service to ensure a fair and just tax system for all.</p>
<p>If anyone is equipped to navigate the murky tax seas, it’s Captain Jeffrey A. Schneider.</p>
