			<p>If you are under audit from the IRS or in receipt of a notice of additional tax due, the steps you take next could make all the difference. There is a strong temptation to ignore these communications, however, doing nothing will not make the IRS go away. Indeed, the longer you wait, the more dire the situation will become.</p>
<p>Every day you wait is one more day the IRS will tack on fees, penalties, and additional interest. Before you make the situation worse, it is time to face the problem head on, even if that means hiring a tax resolution professional.</p>
<p>There are plenty of reasons to consider a tax resolution professional, especially if you do not have the money to pay what you owe. You may also want to consult a tax resolution professional if you disagree with the determination, or if you are confused by what the IRS is claiming. If you find that hiring a tax resolution firm is the right move, here are some key things to look for.</p>
<p>As an expert Tax Resolution Firm ourselves, we encourage all readers facing a tax problem to contact us for a free consultation either by phone at 877-355-8010 or email Marissa our office manager at <a href="mailto:marissa@sfstaxacct.com">marissa@sfstaxacct.com</a></p>
<h2>Skilled and Qualified Professionals</h2>
<p>The quality of the professional you receive will be directly impacted by the knowledge of the individuals who work there. The best tax resolution companies go out of their way to hire real experts, including men and women who have spent time working for the IRS.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3898 size-full" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/handshake-sfs.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/handshake-sfs.jpg 1000w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/handshake-sfs-300x200.jpg 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/handshake-sfs-768x512.jpg 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/handshake-sfs-700x467.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>This insider knowledge is hard to beat, and it is one of the key things to look for when hiring a tax resolution professional. Look for employees who spent time in the trenches, working directly on tax law, auditing and other related fields.</p>
<p>Relevant Experience<br />
Deep experience is critical when hiring a tax resolution professional. The tax code is extremely complicated, and it gets longer with every year. Look for individuals with relevant experience in all aspects of tax law, from ferreting out fraud to defending taxpayers who have simply made honest mistakes.</p>
<p>Always ask about the expertise and experience of the people who work for the tax resolution firm. Things like the longevity of service, background, and training can be pivotal, and they could tip the scales in favor of one tax resolution professional over another.</p>
<h2>The Availability of Specialists</h2>
<p>Not all tax situations are the same. The small business owner who receives a surprise tax bill will have different needs, and different questions, than a single mom.</p>
<p>When hiring a tax resolution professional, it is important to look for specialists who can help with your unique situation. Interview the company representative carefully, placing special emphasis on what you are expecting and what you would consider a fair resolution with the IRS.</p>
<h2>Deep Knowledge of Tax Resolution</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3899 size-full" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/books-sfs.jpg" alt="" width="796" height="340" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/books-sfs.jpg 796w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/books-sfs-300x128.jpg 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/books-sfs-768x328.jpg 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/books-sfs-700x299.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 796px) 100vw, 796px" />The U.S. tax code is anything but static; the government is constantly making changes. Those changes can have a profound impact on how much employees pay in taxes, the size of the refunds they receive and if their deductions will be approved.</p>
<p>When hiring a tax resolution professional, look for deep knowledge of not just tax law, but the programs available to resolve your tax problem. Continuing education in tax resolution specifically is a big deal for tax resolution professionals, and it is something you should insist on when interviewing potential providers.</p>
<p>No one likes to deal with the IRS, and sometimes you need some help in doing so. Whether you receive an audit notice or find a tax bill in your mailbox, you need to take steps to protect yourself and your money. A tax resolution professional can negotiate with the IRS on your behalf, potentially saving you money and helping you avoid legal and financial penalties. Knowing what to look for in such a service can help you get the most for your money, so you can stay on the good side of the IRS.</p>
