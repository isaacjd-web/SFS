<p>Though our firm specializes in helping people resolve their IRS or state back tax problems, we also love saving you money. After all, one of the best ways to avoid getting into tax trouble is to minimize your liabilities.</p>
<h2><strong><img class="alignright wp-image-2683" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Year-End-Tax-Saving-Strategies-girl-writing-sticky-notes.jpg" alt="" width="374" height="223" /></strong></h2>
<p>The end of the year is the perfect time to review your finances and the perfect time to make some smart tax-saving moves. Making the right moves at the end of the year can possibly reduce your tax liability and allow you to keep more of what you earn.</p>
<p>From accelerating expenses to boosting the amount you put away for retirement, there are things you can do to lower your tax burden. You may not be able to control the tax fight in Washington, but you can limit the amount you pay by assessing your own tax situation and making some prudent changes.</p>
<h2><strong>Accelerate Your Expenses</strong></h2>
<p>Individual taxpayers are on the cash basis for income tax purposes. This means your income is taxable when you receive it and expenses count when you pay them. Depending on your situation, shifting deductions between years can make a big difference on your tax bill. With this knowledge, making additional deductible payments prior to the end of the year may be a good idea. Examples include property tax payments, mortgage interest payments, and charitable donations.</p>
<h2><strong>Boost Your 401(k) Contributions </strong></h2>
<h2><strong><img class="alignright wp-image-2684" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Year-End-Tax-Saving-Strategies-girl-writing-white-board.jpg" alt="Year-End Tax Saving Strategies, girl, writing, white board" width="604" height="903" /></strong></h2>
<p>As the year ticks down to its close, it pays to look at your most recent pay stub and see how much you have already contributed to your 401(k) plan. Contributing to a 401(k) plan is an excellent way to save on taxes since every dollar you put in is deducted from your taxable income.</p>
<p>For 2018, you can contribute up to $18,500 to your 401(k) plan, plus an extra 6,000  if you are 50 or older. Also, if you have not yet maxed out your 401(k), now is the perfect time to boost your contributions and make up for lost time.  Keep in mind that many companies allow you to change your contribution percentage any time you wish. Boosting the amount you put in between now and the end of the year can make a huge difference. You can adjust your contribution downward in the new year if you wish, but at least consider leaving it at its new elevated level.</p>
<h2><strong>Gather Your Donations</strong></h2>
<p style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 200%; font-family: 'Microsoft Sans Serif','sans-serif';">Donating to charity makes you feel good, but it can also be good for your wallet. If you itemize your deductions, you may be able to take a deduction for not only cash contributions but gifts of household goods and clothing as well.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 200%; font-family: 'Microsoft Sans Serif','sans-serif';">Take a few minutes this weekend to go through your closets and storage areas. First, look for usable items you no longer need. Box them up and take them down to your local thrift store or other charity. Be sure to get a receipt that shows what you donated, along with the approximate value. </span></p>
<h2><strong>Contact Your Enrolled Agent</strong></h2>
<p style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 200%; font-family: 'Microsoft Sans Serif','sans-serif';">This is a short list of some of the ideas you can use to lower your tax obligation in 2018. If you need an expert tax resolution professional, reach out to us and we’ll schedule a no-obligation confidential consultation. Jeffrey Schneider, EA, CTRS will explain your options and help permanently resolve your tax problem.</span></p>

Attempting to cut your tax liability by getting into IRS grey areas can cause you problems later on. You don&#8217;t have to do anything unethical to get your return pulled for an audit; you may just have raised too many red flags. Also, an audit can be done via letter, (i.e. <a href="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/now-what-i-got-a-cp2000-notice-help/">CP2000 Notice</a>) not just face-to-face. If you’re in the middle of an audit, or owe back taxes, contact Jeffrey Schneider, EA, CTRS to resolve your tax problem(s). Here are the top 10 red flags the IRS target that you want to avoid:</p>
<h3><strong>1. Making too much money</strong></h3>
<p>First, here&#8217;s a problem most of us would dream to have. Making over $200,000! You&#8217;re honestly more likely to be audited. The fact is that there are fewer auditors, so the IRS is focusing on where they can make the most bang for their buck.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Not reporting all of your income </strong></h3>
<p>No matter how much or little you make, you have to report everything. In some way or other, unless you run a strictly cash business, all of your income is reported to the IRS. W2, 1099 and other forms you receive are duplicated, then they are sent in to the IRS. If your reported income doesn&#8217;t match theirs, you will get a notice.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Math errors </strong></h3>
<p>Your information will be entered into a computer whether you file electronically or file a paper form. Remember, the one thing computers are very good at is doing math and if things don’t add up, or there was an honest mistake while inputting the information, it can raise a red flag. A math error won&#8217;t necessarily generate an audit, but it will get the attention you may not want. Make sure to double check your returns. Better yet, have a qualified tax professional assist you and keep you out of tax trouble.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Home businesses that never make money<img class="alignright wp-image-1933" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/How-to-Avoid-Being-Audited-cartoon-woman-shocked-thinking-i-thought-i-could-just-write-it-off.jpg" alt="How to Avoid Being Audited, cartoon woman, shocked, thinking, i thought i could just write it off" width="262" height="388" /></strong></h3>
<p>Sole proprietorships that file a Schedule C year after year and always show a loss will raise a red flag. You could even show a profit, but if the profit margin is always unreasonably small, then that will get the IRS&#8217; attention.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Large charitable deductions</strong></h3>
<p>There is nothing wrong with being charitable and there is no legal limit to how much of your hard earned cash you can give away. It is another red flag, however, if your donation is different than what’s considered the norm.</p>
<h3><strong>6. Overstating business expenses</strong></h3>
<p>Depending on the type of job you have, there can be many legitimate expenses that your employer doesn&#8217;t reimburse you for. Don&#8217;t be tempted to write off just a little extra if you have your own business. These might be genuine deductions you&#8217;re considering. However, you don&#8217;t want to deduct something that&#8217;s not on the approved list and don&#8217;t claim deductions way outside the norm. Check with your tax professional – or if you don’t have one, consider Jeffrey Schneider, EA, CTRS, NPTI Fellow &#8211; who is up to date with tax laws. You don’t want to be padding your tax return with write-offs.</p>
<h3><strong>7. Sketchy real estate rental revenue or losses</strong></h3>
<p>Some people will &#8216;rent&#8217; their property to friends or family at well below market value and then claim normal rental business expenses. As with other areas, the IRS compares what you claim against local standards to determine if this is a legit business. If not, they will disallow the deductions.</p>
<h3><strong>8. Home office deductions</strong></h3>
<p>There are absolutely legitimate home office deductions but the IRS has very strict guidelines on what you can claim and how much. Try to claim too much and this is a classic red flag.</p>
<h3><strong>9. Claiming losses for things that aren&#8217;t deductible or deductible in your circumstances </strong></h3>
<p>For example, claiming day-trading losses on a Schedule C. If you dabble in stock trading and take a loss, it may or may not be deductible, but almost certainly doesn&#8217;t qualify for a Schedule C loss. You also can&#8217;t take a deduction for alimony as a business expense. The IRS maintains a list of non-deductible expenses, make sure to check that and check with your tax professional.</p>
<h3><strong><img class="alignright wp-image-1934" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/How-to-Avoid-Being-Audited-red-bentley-mountains-cloudy-skies-interior-car.jpg" alt="How to Avoid Being Audited, red, bentley, mountains, cloudy, skies, interior, car" width="324" height="226" /></strong></h3>
<h3><strong>10. Claiming 100% business use of your vehicle</strong></h3>
<p>If you spend most of the time in your vehicle doing your job, you may think it&#8217;s easier just to claim the whole amount as a business expense, but this is wrong. You will either have to show your personal use, no matter how small, or have to show you have a second vehicle for personal use.</p>
<h2><strong>How it Gets Confusing</strong></h2>
<p>Many of these items are red flags for an audit, but many are also legitimate deductions. The key is to have a qualified tax professional on your side. When it comes to tax resolution, Jeffrey Schneider, EA, CTRS knows how to navigate the IRS maze. He can help you minimize the risk of an audit and the resulting tax problems down the road. Also, he will ensure you have meticulous records and keep you within the guidelines of the IRS.</p>
<p>If you need an expert tax resolution professional, reach out to us and we’ll schedule a no-obligation confidential consultation. Jeffrey Schneider, EA, CTRS will explain your options and help permanently resolve your tax problem.</p>
