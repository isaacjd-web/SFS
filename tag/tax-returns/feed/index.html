<p>How long has it been? 3 years? More? 10? Some people have never filed taxes. Why not? <img class="alignright wp-image-3707 " src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Havent-Filed-Taxes-in-a-While-child-oops-shocked-face-tea-cup-1.jpg" alt="Haven't Filed Taxes in a While, child, oops, shocked face, tea cup" width="200" height="319" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“I couldn’t gather all of my records.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“My ex used to do them for me. I never learned how!”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“My accountant died.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“I’m in too deep.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“If I bring attention to the issue, the IRS is going to notice me and find things I never even <strong>realized</strong> I did wrong.”</em></p>
<h2><strong>Why Do We Have to File Tax Returns? </strong></h2>
<h2><strong><img class="alignright wp-image-3708 " src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Havent-Filed-Taxes-in-a-While-vacation-destination-beach-airplane-1.jpg" alt="" width="345" height="441" /></strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>It’s against the law not to file. This can be a felony… and you don’t it want following you the rest of your life.</li>
<li>If you’d like to buy or refinance a house, you need to prove that you’ve filed your returns.</li>
<li>If you want to get married one day, not filing can be a deal breaker because it carries <em>tons </em>of problems.</li>
<li>The IRS might file substitute-for-returns for you without deductions and you’ll owe them more than if you had just filed yourself.</li>
<li>If you owe $50,000 or more, your passport privileges will be revoked by the IRS. This means you can’t escape to Mexico before getting caught.</li>
<li>If you’re self-employed, you might miss out on increased Social Security contributions for when you retire.</li>
<li>You’re required to have filed to obtain health insurance.</li>
<li>You won’t be able to get student loan aid for your kids (FAFSA)</li>
<li>It will reduce your chances of having your identity stolen.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Do I Need to File Every Year?</strong></h2>
<p>Not typically, no. The IRS wants to see your last seven years of returns on file. However, if the IRS filed for you, you’ll want to replace the Substitute for Returns with returns of your own to reduce the balance they assessed. If you’re getting refunds and won’t owe taxes, you only have to worry about the last 4 years.</p>
<h2><strong>Alright, This is Too Much</strong></h2>
<p>Your Enrolled Agent will take thorough information on your tax situation and can handle this for you. Jeffrey A. Schneider EA, CTRS, NTPIF, ACT-E can determine exactly the number of years that need to be filed. He can find out whether the IRS has filed for you or not, find out whether or not you’ll be getting refunds that you may be entitled to, and set you up for future success.</p>

In 2016, only 0.6% of individual income tax returns were audited according to the IRS 2017 Data Book. Why?

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Will My Income Tax Return be Audited?</strong></h1>
<p>For the vast majority of taxpayers, there is not much need to worry that you will be audited. In 2016, only 0.6% of individual income tax returns were audited according to the IRS <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/17databk.pdf">2017 Data Book</a>. Why? For starters, after the IRS budget cuts, we lost 2,200 agents that previously audited returns.</p>
<p>The “real” audit rate, however, is closer to 7.0%. The IRS does not include the over 9.2 million notices that are questioning items on your client’s tax returns (such as forgetting to include a 1099-Misc form).  The IRS is relying more and more on technology to uncover underreporting and underpayment of taxes.</p>
<p>The following are the different taxpayer groups are more susceptible to catching the attention of auditors.</p>
<p><img class="alignright  wp-image-2350" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Will-My-Income-Tax-Return-be-Audited-atlas-map-international-countries.jpg" alt="Will My Income Tax Return be Audited?" width="276" height="181" /></p>
<h3>Returns that report more than $10 Million in income or report no income</h3>
<p>Sixteen percent of individuals who reported over $10 million in income were audited in 2014. Surprisingly, the IRS audited those returns at a higher rate than those that reported no income.</p>
<p>The IRS audited 5.3% of tax returns with no income in 2014. If your income is $25,000 &#8211; $200,000, it is unlikely that you will be singled out for an audit.</p>
<h3><strong>Estate Tax Returns of More than $5 Million</strong></h3>
<p>In 2014, the IRS did an audit on 8.5% of estate tax returns which was well above the .9% of individual returns. 21% of even larger estate tax returns (between $5 million to $10 million) were audited, while 27% of those over $10 million received an audit.</p>
<h3><strong>Individual Filing of International Returns Raises a Red Flag</strong></h3>
<p>The IRS is focusing more attention on international returns. Statements made by experts in the field, strongly emphasized the practice of <a href="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/irs-forces-full-disclosure-for-overseas-accounts/">offshore tax evasion</a> as being fundamentally unfair. Wealthy people evading the law by stashing their money overseas and not paying their share of tax is forcing the bulk of lower income citizens to foot the bill to fund the government. In 2014, they audited 4.8% of international returns.</p>
<h3><strong>Errors in Information Entered</strong></h3>
<p>If someone filling out income tax forms makes simple, careless mistakes, red flags go up to the tax auditors. Filers neglect to get all report forms and statements together and forget to report dependents and exemptions correctly. The automated systems recognize these discrepancies, but can&#8217;t tell if they are actual mistakes or intentional. <a href="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/how-to-avoid-being-audited/">Neglecting to report all your income</a> and other figures could result in an audit especially at higher incomes. Those who contribute to more charities and other organizations open up the possibility for fraud.</p>
<h3><strong>Reports of Unrealistic Itemized Deductions<img class="alignright  wp-image-2351" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Will-My-Income-Tax-Return-be-Audited-finance-sheet-apple-coffee-camera-cactus.jpg" alt="Will My Income Tax Return be Audited, finance, sheet, apple, coffee, camera, cactus" width="355" height="234" /></strong></h3>
<p>An individual or small business could be signaled out for an audited if they claim itemized deductions that are clearly out of line. Filers need to know what a legitimate deduction entails.</p>
<p>Carefully reading directions for completing forms and checking for accuracy and honesty will reduce the chances of an audit. Hiring a tax professional, specifically someone with tax resolution experience like our firm, can help you stay out of tax trouble.</p>
<p>If you need an expert tax resolution professional, reach out to us and we’ll schedule a no-obligation confidential consultation. Jeffrey Schneider, EA, CTRS will explain your options and help permanently resolve your tax problem.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now that tax season is over are you itching to clean out your office and garage and get rid of boxes of old tax returns? Do you know which records you can toss and what to save?</p>
<p>I am regularly asked, “How long should I hold on to my tax records?”</p>
<p>While there are few hard and fast rules, here are some guidelines we urge all our clients to keep in mind as they organize their records.</p>
<p><strong>For individuals</strong></p>
<p>You should retain any records that support items shown on your individual tax return until the statute of limitations runs out, which in most cases is three years from the date you filed your return.</p>
<p>However, in some cases, the statute of limitations is longer. If you understated your adjusted gross income by more than 25 percent, for example, the limitations period is six years. The statute of limitations does not begin until you file a tax return. It may wise to keep your records for the full six years so you can defend against any charges of gross understatements. It would be hard to defend against this allegation if you don’t have the records to substantiate. I tend to recommend keeping your records for seven years, just to be safe.</p>
<p>You can also file an amended return on Form 1040X during the general three-year statute of limitations period if you missed a deduction, overlooked a credit or misreported income.</p>
<ul>
<li>Real estate records. Keep these records for as long as you own the property, plus three years after you dispose of it and the transaction is reported on your tax return. Retain receipts for home improvements, relevant insurance claims, and any refinancing documents. This help to prove your adjusted basis in the property, which is needed to determine the taxable gain at the time of sale of a personal residence, or to support calculations for rental property or home office deductions, should you be claiming those on a return.</li>
<li>Traditional and Roth IRAs. The IRS requires you to maintain records of your basis in your IRA accounts until all the money is withdrawn from your IRA accounts. In most cases, that basis is tracked on Form 8606. For Roth IRAs, hold on to all records pertaining to contributions and withdrawals. If an account is closed, treat IRA records the same as records for stocks and bonds. Don’t dispose of any ownership documentation until the statute of limitations expires.</li>
<li>Stocks and bonds. To report taxable events involving stocks and bonds, retain detailed records of purchases and sales. These records should include dates, quantities, prices, dividend reinvestments and investment expenses, such as broker fees. You should hold on to these records for as long as you own the investments, plus the three-year statute of limitations for the relevant tax returns.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For businesses</strong></p>
<p>If you own a small business, record retention procedures will look a little different. The IRS recommends keeping employee records for three years after an employee has been terminated. In addition, maintain records that support employee earnings for at least four years.</p>
<ul>
<li>Timecards specifically must be kept for at least three years if your business engages in interstate commerce and is subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act. However, it’s a best practice for all businesses, regardless of geography, to keep the files for several years.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are our more specific recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Employment tax records. Keep for four years from the date the tax was due or the date it was paid, whichever is longer.</li>
<li>Travel and entertainment records. For travel and transportation expenses supported by mileage logs and other receipts, keep supporting documents for the statute of limitations period.</li>
<li>Sales tax returns. Because regulations vary by state, please check with a tax professional for the most accurate and up-to-date information. For example, the statute of limitations in Florida is generally 10 years.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When in doubt, keep it</strong></p>
<p>It’s easy to accumulate a mountain of paperwork from years’ worth of tax and financial records (though you may consider securely digitizing your records to save space). If you are unsure whether you should retain a document, a good rule of thumb is to hold on to it for at least seven years or, for property, at least three years after the tax return reporting its disposition is filed.</p>
