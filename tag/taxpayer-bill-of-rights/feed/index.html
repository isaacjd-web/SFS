<p>Did you know, as a taxpayer, you have your own Bill of Rights? The IRS has adopted a Taxpayer Bill of Rights for all of their dealings with the IRS. Chapter 5 of <em>Now What? The IRS is Taking Everything I Own. Help!</em> goes over all ten and what they mean for you. We put together a little summary.</p>
<h2><strong>I. The Right to Be Informed</strong></h2>
<p>Taxpayers have the right to know what they need to do to comply with the tax laws. They are entitled to clear explanations of the law and IRS procedures in all tax forms.</p>
<h2><strong>II. The Right to Quality Service <img class="alignright wp-image-3640 " src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/The-Protection-and-Fundamental-Rights-You-Have-with-the-IRS-The-Taxpayer-Bill-of-Rights-sfs-sfstax-jeffrey-schneider-now-what-help-mailbox-us-mail-1.jpg" alt="" width="523" height="407" /></strong></h2>
<p>Taxpayers have the right to receive prompt, courteous, and professional assistance in their dealings with the IRS, to be spoken to in a way they can easily understand, to receive clear and easily understandable communications from the IRS, and to have a way to file complaints about inadequate service.</p>
<h2><strong>III. The Right to Pay No More than the Correct Amount of Tax</strong></h2>
<p>Taxpayers have the right to pay only the amount of tax legally due and to have the IRS apply all tax payments properly.</p>
<h2><strong>IV. The Right to Challenge the IRS’ Position and Be Heard</strong></h2>
<p>Taxpayers have the right to raise objections and provide additional documentation in response to formal IRS actions or proposed actions, to expect that the IRS will fairly consider their timely objections and documentation promptly and fairly, and to receive a response if the IRS does not agree with their position.</p>
<h2><strong>V. The Right to Appeal an IRS Decision in an Independent Forum</strong></h2>
<p>Taxpayers are entitled to a fair and impartial administrative appeal of most IRS decisions, including many penalties, and have the right to receive a written response regarding the Office of Appeals’ decision. Taxpayers generally have the right to take their cases to court.</p>
<h2><strong>VI. The Right to Finality</strong></h2>
<p>Taxpayers have the right to know the maximum amount of time they have to challenge the IRS’s position, as well as the maximum amount of time the IRS has to audit a particular tax year or collect a tax debt. Taxpayers have the right to know when the IRS has finished an audit.</p>
<h2><strong>VII. The Right to Privacy <img class="alignright wp-image-3641 " src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/The-Protection-and-Fundamental-Rights-You-Have-with-the-IRS-The-Taxpayer-Bill-of-Rights-sfs-sfstax-jeffrey-schneider-now-what-help-key-padlock.jpg" alt="The Protection and Fundamental Rights You Have with the IRS, The Taxpayer Bill of Rights, sfs, sfstax, jeffrey schneider, now what help, key, padlock" width="590" height="494" /></strong></h2>
<p>Taxpayers have the right to expect that any IRS inquiry, examination, or enforcement action will comply with the law, be no more intrusive than necessary, and will respect all due process rights. This includes search and seizure protections and a collection due process hearing where applicable.</p>
<h2><strong>VIII. The Right to Confidentiality</strong></h2>
<p>Taxpayers have the right to expect that any information that they provide to the IRS will not be disclosed unless authorized by the taxpayer or by law. Taxpayers have the right to expect the IRS to investigate and take appropriate action against its employees, return preparers, and others who wrongfully use or disclose taxpayer return information.</p>
<h2><strong>IX. The Right to Retain Representation</strong></h2>
<p>Taxpayers have the right to retain an authorized representative of their choice to represent them in their dealings with the IRS. Taxpayers have the right to be told that, if they cannot afford to hire a representative, they may be eligible for assistance from a Low-Income Taxpayer Clinic.</p>
<h2><strong>X. The Right to a Fair and Just Tax System</strong></h2>
<p>Taxpayers have the right to expect the tax system to consider facts and circumstances that might affect their underlying liabilities, ability to pay, or ability to provide information in a timely manner. Taxpayers have the right to receive assistance from the Taxpayer Advocate Service if they are experiencing financial difficulty or the IRS has not resolved their tax issues properly and in a timely manner through its normal channels.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The Protection and Fundamental Rights You Have with the IRS. An SFS Tax Problem Solutions Blog. </em></p>
<p>You innocently walk over to your mailbox. There are usual bills and flyers, and… an unexpected notice from the IRS.</p>
<p>Argh!</p>
<p>You feel your stomach sink. Your heart is pounding out of your chest and your knees go weak.</p>
<p>Something about that IRS logo on a number 10 envelope that sends people into a panic!</p>
<p>The first thing to do?</p>
<p>Take a deep breath.<strong><img class=" wp-image-1069 aligncenter" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Chapter-4-Blog-Secondary-Image-300x83.png" alt="The Protection and Fundamental Rights You Have as a Taxpayer, SFS Tax Problem Solutions, No Panic" width="549" height="152" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Chapter-4-Blog-Secondary-Image-300x83.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Chapter-4-Blog-Secondary-Image-768x212.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Chapter-4-Blog-Secondary-Image-700x193.png 700w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Chapter-4-Blog-Secondary-Image.png 935w" sizes="(max-width: 549px) 100vw, 549px" /></strong></p>
<h3><strong>The Protection and Fundamental Rights You Have with the IRS: Yes, They Exist! </strong></h3>
<p>The IRS is not going to show up at your door. They will not come for you at 3 am. They will not call you every five minutes at work or blow up your cell phone with hundreds of texts and emails.</p>
<p>Consider this first letter a conversation opener.</p>
<p>Yes, you will have to respond. But you don’t have to be paralyzed by fear.</p>
<p>For some reason, people can feel helpless when it comes to the IRS. It’s as if their constitutional rights evaporated the moment they opened that mailbox.</p>
<h3><strong>The Protection and Fundamental Rights You Have with the IRS: The Taxpayer Bill of Rights  </strong></h3>
<p>Whether you know it or not, it’s just not true that you are powerless against the IRS.</p>
<p>Not only are all your rights still intact, but the IRS goes one step farther in ensuring you are treated fairly.</p>
<p>They have their own Bill of Rights, called the Taxpayer Bill of Rights.</p>
<p>Included in this Taxpayer Bill of Rights is the right to appeal IRS decisions and to hire someone to represent you.</p>
<p>The bottom line is you don’t have to face this alone. You needn’t fear that you will be stalked like a hunted animal, or that you can’t fight IRS’s allegations against you.</p>
<p>The IRS must abide by the Taxpayer Bill of Rights.</p>
<p>So relax and open that notice. It’s not the end of the world. You can survive (even thrive) after this!</p>
