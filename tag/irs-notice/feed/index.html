								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A CP523 notice will not be the first time you’ve dealt with the IRS.</p>
<p>In fact, you need to first have an installment agreement with the IRS in order to receive one.</p>
<p>It is a cause for concern, however.</p>
<h3><strong>Why Am I Getting a CP523 Notice? </strong></h3>
<p>You are getting a CP523 notice because the IRS considers you in default on your installment agreement.</p>
<p>Missing a payment is one way to be considered in default, but there are other reasons as well. If you have an installment agreement with the IRS and have a new balance due, or haven’t filed a tax return, you may also be considered to be in default.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-1462 size-full aligncenter" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Now-What-I-Got-a-CP523-Notice-from-the-IRS-Help-SFS-Tax-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-CP523-CP523-notice-IRS-notice.png" alt="Now What, I Got a CP523 Notice from the IRS, Help, SFS Tax, SFS Tax Problem Solutions, CP523, CP523 notice, IRS notice" width="651" height="822" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Now-What-I-Got-a-CP523-Notice-from-the-IRS-Help-SFS-Tax-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-CP523-CP523-notice-IRS-notice.png 651w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Now-What-I-Got-a-CP523-Notice-from-the-IRS-Help-SFS-Tax-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-CP523-CP523-notice-IRS-notice-238x300.png 238w" sizes="(max-width: 651px) 100vw, 651px" /></p>
<h3><strong>What is the CP523 Telling Me? </strong></h3>
<p>The CP523 is informing you of the IRS’s intention to terminate your installment agreement and seize your assets. They can file a federal tax lien against your social security number, levy your bank accounts and garnish your wages in order to satisfy your debt.</p>
<p>Sounds harsh, right?</p>
<p>Take a deep breath.</p>
<p>There are ways to get back on track should you receive this notice.</p>
<h3><strong>What Do I Do? </strong></h3>
<p>On the notice, you will see a termination date for your installment agreement. (Generally, 30 days from the date of the notice).</p>
<p>You can make the missing payment by that date in order to keep your agreement in place.</p>
<p>You may also be able to reinstate your agreement by contacting the IRS. Be aware that there may be a fee involved in order to do this.</p>
<p>You can also contact an Enrolled Agent (EA) to contact the IRS on your behalf.</p>
<p>Whatever you do, make sure you respond before the termination date.</p>
<h3><strong>Know Your Rights</strong></h3>
<p>You do have the right to appeal if you don’t agree with the IRS on the reason they are terminating your agreement. Once again, the help of an experienced EA is priceless. An EA can tell you if you have a case and what your next steps should be (and again, approaching the IRS on your behalf).</p>
<h3><strong>The Last Word</strong></h3>
<p>It can be scary to get any notice from the IRS, let alone one that uses the words “seize” and “levy” together with “your assets.” However, with a CP523, you do have options to righting things with the IRS and preventing a big mess. Don’t delay… take those steps right away!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You diligently complete and file your tax return… to your delight, you’re getting a refund! You are excited when you see the IRS envelope show up in your mailbox. At last, your money is here! Now you can pay bills/get your car fixed/blow it in a shopping spree.</p>
<p>Not so fast.</p>
<p>When you open the envelope, there is no check. There is only a notice.</p>
<p>In the upper right-hand corner, you see that it is a CP49.</p>
<p>What the heck does that mean?</p>
<p><strong> <img class="wp-image-1432 size-full alignright" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Now-What-I-Got-a-CP49-Notice-from-the-IRS-Help-SFS-Tax-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-CP49-CP49-notice.png" alt="Now What, I Got a CP49 Notice from the IRS, Help, SFS Tax, SFS Tax Problem Solutions, CP49, CP49 notice" width="612" height="789" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Now-What-I-Got-a-CP49-Notice-from-the-IRS-Help-SFS-Tax-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-CP49-CP49-notice.png 612w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Now-What-I-Got-a-CP49-Notice-from-the-IRS-Help-SFS-Tax-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-CP49-CP49-notice-233x300.png 233w" sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" /></strong></p>
<h3><strong>A CP49 Notice: What You Need to Know</strong></h3>
<p>You will receive a CP49 notice from the IRS when you file for a refund, but that refund is applied to an underpayment of taxes for another year.</p>
<p>The CP49 is pretty explicit in its explanation.</p>
<p>On the sample form to the left, it says “We applied your 2017 Form 1040 overpayment to an unpaid balance.” (In the eyes of the IRS, you are issued a refund when you overpay your taxes throughout the year; thus you have an overpayment that needs to be refunded).</p>
<p>Now, it’s not really an overpayment if you owe tax from some other year. Therefore, if there’s still an outstanding balance on that account, your “refund” will go toward that balance.</p>
<p>If there is any money left after paying off your outstanding balance, then the CP49 will state this.</p>
<h3><strong>What if My Refund is Larger than My Old Tax Debt? </strong></h3>
<p>You will get the remainder of your refund, if there is any.</p>
<p>As you can see on the sample form above,, this person had an outstanding tax debt of $500 and filed for a $750 refund. The CP49 states that the refund due will now be $250 after the IRS applied $500 to the amount owed.</p>
<p>Just in case there is any confusion, the CP49 will also state what year the taxes were owed. In this case, it was 2015.</p>
<p>To sum it all up, the form states “As a result, your refund has been reduced to $250.00.” In the Summary section, the math is broken out to make everything crystal clear.</p>
<h3><strong>When Will You Receive Your Remaining Refund? </strong></h3>
<p>Any refund leftover after satisfying an old tax debt should be received within two to three weeks of the CP49 notice.</p>
<p>Now, if the IRS finds <em>more</em> outstanding tax debts, that won’t happen.</p>
<p>The CP49 also informs you that it won’t be depositing your remaining refund in your bank account, even if you asked for it. Because of the “additional processing” time, you will be receiving a paper check.</p>

<h3><strong>What if I Don’t Have Any Unpaid Taxes? </strong></h3>
<p>If you were aware of an outstanding balance, receiving a CP49 notice should not be a shock to you.</p>
<p>However, if it is news to you that you even had an outstanding balance, don’t panic.</p>
<p>A CP49 notice lets you know that the IRS believes that you do.</p>
<p>You will now need to take steps to clear up the confusion before you can get that refund (overpayment) you were counting on.</p>
<p>One possible scenario is that a former (or current) spouse has a debt you are unaware of. If you filed “married filing jointly” for the tax year in question, then you are jointly liable for the debt. This is why the IRS includes its “protection from your spouse’s debt” section.</p>
<p>If you aren’t liable for your spouse’s tax debt, you do have options. The IRS calls the provision “injured spouse.” You may be able to get back your portion of a refund that was used to pay your spouse’s tax debt.</p>
<p>You can submit a claim with the IRS or enlist the help of an Enrolled Agent (EA) can help you get back what is rightfully yours.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #000000;">You’ve opened that ominous IRS envelope and found that you have a notice. In the upper right-hand corner of the first page, it identifies itself as a CP19 notice.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>What is a CP19 Notice? </strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">A CP19 notice informs you that the IRS has increased the amount of tax you owe.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Why? Because they believe you claimed one or more deductions or credits you shouldn’t have.</span></p>
<h3><strong><img class="size-medium wp-image-1326 alignright" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Now-What-I-Got-a-CP19-Notice-from-the-IRS-SFS-Tax-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Man-Jumping-Wilderness-Nature-Scene-300x200.png" alt="Now What, I Got a CP19 Notice from the IRS, SFS Tax, SFS Tax Problem Solutions, Man Jumping, Wilderness, Nature Scene" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Now-What-I-Got-a-CP19-Notice-from-the-IRS-SFS-Tax-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Man-Jumping-Wilderness-Nature-Scene-300x200.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Now-What-I-Got-a-CP19-Notice-from-the-IRS-SFS-Tax-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Man-Jumping-Wilderness-Nature-Scene-700x466.png 700w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Now-What-I-Got-a-CP19-Notice-from-the-IRS-SFS-Tax-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Man-Jumping-Wilderness-Nature-Scene.png 763w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><span style="color: #000000;">Why does the IRS Think I’ve Made an Error? </span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Besides your return, the IRS receives financial data about you from third parties such as your employers, clients, banks and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As you know, there are also many rules about what you can claim as a deduction and what qualifies you for a tax credit.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Based on the information available to them (or lack thereof), the IRS has made the determination that you owe additional tax.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Now What? </strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Stay calm. Breathe. You have the opportunity to review the changes they’ve made and respond.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The IRS can make mistakes. Sometimes issues arise that could be resolved with further documentation.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">As the IRS advises, you may want to review this notice with your tax professional.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1327 alignleft" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Now-What-I-Got-a-CP19-Notice-from-the-IRS-SFS-Tax-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-People-in-Business-Wear-Enrolled-Agents-EAs-300x243.png" alt="Now What, I Got a CP19 Notice from the IRS, SFS Tax, SFS Tax Problem Solutions, People in Business Wear, Enrolled Agents, EAs" width="300" height="243" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Now-What-I-Got-a-CP19-Notice-from-the-IRS-SFS-Tax-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-People-in-Business-Wear-Enrolled-Agents-EAs-300x243.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Now-What-I-Got-a-CP19-Notice-from-the-IRS-SFS-Tax-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-People-in-Business-Wear-Enrolled-Agents-EAs.png 626w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />If you prepared your return on your own, now would be a great time to call in the expertise of an Enrolled Agent (EA). An EA can review your return to see if it was completed correctly and if there is another deduction or credit you are entitled to that can offset the error.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Your EA will also advise as to the best course of action if you do end up owing the IRS.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>How Do I Prevent the IRS from Sending Me Notices? </strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Filing your taxes correctly each year will go a long way toward preventing problems down the road. With new tax laws coming out on a regular basis, it’s a good idea to get an experienced EA to help you file your taxes each year.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #000000;">Think of the CP90 notice as a big red flag. If you are receiving one from the IRS, this is your last chance.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The CP90 notifies you of the IRS’ intention to garnish your wages, levy your property, or seize your bank accounts to pay your tax debt.</span></p>
<h3><strong>You Should Have Received Notices Before This</strong></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">A CP90 is not the first notice the IRS will send to you regarding an unpaid tax balance. Multiple notices go out before this one.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore, you will not receive a CP90 if you have responded to prior notices. If you have submitted an installment agreement or an offer in compromise request, you should not receive a CP90… unless the IRS rejected your request.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">If you have taken previous action but are still receiving a CP90 notice, you should speak with an Enrolled Agent (EA). An EA can speak to the IRS on your behalf to track down what happened and restore your good standing with the IRS.</span></p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-1316 alignright" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Now-What-I-Got-a-CP90-Notice-from-the-IRS-Help-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-angry-cat-cute-cat-300x297.png" alt="Now What, I Got a CP90 Notice from the IRS, Help, SFS Tax Problem Solutions, angry cat, cute cat" width="300" height="297" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Now-What-I-Got-a-CP90-Notice-from-the-IRS-Help-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-angry-cat-cute-cat-300x297.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Now-What-I-Got-a-CP90-Notice-from-the-IRS-Help-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-angry-cat-cute-cat-150x150.png 150w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Now-What-I-Got-a-CP90-Notice-from-the-IRS-Help-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-angry-cat-cute-cat.png 515w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<h3><strong>What Can I Do if I Get a CP90 Notice? </strong></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">You have 30 days from the date of the notice to take action. You can either:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Appeal the decision,</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Pay the balance in full,</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Arrange for a payment plan, or</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Propose an offer in compromise</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">If you don’t take one of these four actions, the IRS may proceed with levies against any federal payments due to you. They can also file a Federal Tax Lien, which gives them legal claim to your property as payment for your tax debt.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Again, you can empower an EA to act on your behalf to resolve matters with the IRS. Oftentimes people are afraid to act in these situations or are (understandably) afraid to make the wrong move. An EA is both knowledgeable and experienced in dealing with the IRS. He or she can explain your options and represent you before all levels of the IRS.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>April 15<sup>th</sup> is now well behind us. If you didn’t file your tax return (or file for an extension), a CP59 notice from the IRS may soon be appearing in a mailbox near you.</p>
<h3><strong>How Do I Know I Got a CP59 Notice from the IRS? </strong></h3>
<p>In the upper right-hand corner of the first page the type of notice you are receiving with be listed. It will also tell you what tax year the notice is for, the date of the notice, your social security number, a phone number to call as well as a caller ID.</p>
<h3><strong><img class="size-medium wp-image-1244 alignright" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Now-What-I-Got-a-CP59-Notice-from-the-IRS-Help-SFS-Tax-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-CP59-Notice-IRS-Tax-Notice-IRS-Notice-Tax-Notice-225x300.png" alt="Now What, I Got a CP59 Notice from the IRS, Help, SFS Tax, SFS Tax Problem Solutions, CP59 Notice, IRS Tax Notice, IRS Notice, Tax Notice" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Now-What-I-Got-a-CP59-Notice-from-the-IRS-Help-SFS-Tax-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-CP59-Notice-IRS-Tax-Notice-IRS-Notice-Tax-Notice-225x300.png 225w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Now-What-I-Got-a-CP59-Notice-from-the-IRS-Help-SFS-Tax-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-CP59-Notice-IRS-Tax-Notice-IRS-Notice-Tax-Notice.png 555w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" />Why am I Getting this CP59 Notice? </strong></h3>
<p>The message of this notice is simple: You didn’t file your return and now you need to do so. The IRS has a reason to believe that you meet the requirements for filing an income tax return… and they have not received it as of the date of the notice.</p>
<h3><strong>What do I Need to do with a CP59 Notice? </strong></h3>
<p>You will need to do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><u>File your return as soon as possible</u>. Use the envelope provided with the CP59 Notice and include payment if you owe taxes. It’s best to have an Enrolled Agent (EA) or other tax professional help you prepare the return so that you don’t pay more than you need to.</li>
<li><u>Explain to the IRS why you don’t need to file</u>. This can be done using the response form provided with the notice or via the phone number provided on the notice. However, your Enrolled Agent (EA) can help you communicate this to the IRS.</li>
<li><u>Explain why you are filing late</u>. The IRS will want to know why you didn’t file on time. Again, we recommend having a tax professional help you with this communication.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hey, things happen… especially if you mailed your return. It may have gotten lost or been delayed. So if you’ve already filed, you’ll need to let the IRS know this. You can use the response form provided with the notice to do this. You’ll need to include a signed and dated copy of the return.</p>
<h3><strong>What if I Don’t Agree with the Notice? </strong></h3>
<p>If you disagree with the notice, call the IRS at the toll-free number. An IRS contact number is included for you at the top right-hand corner of the notice.</p>
<p>If you are in doubt about what to do for any reason, an EA can help you determine the best course of action.</p>
