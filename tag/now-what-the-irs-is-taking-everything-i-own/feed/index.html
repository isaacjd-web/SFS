<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>“Not everyone is qualified to be a captain of a ship. When you’re miles from land and things get dicey, you want an Admiral, not a weekend sailor. You need a professional who knows what he or she is doing.”</strong></p>
<p>If your case gets remanded back to appeals, there are two other credentialed professionals that can represent you: the Certified Public Accountant and the Enrolled Agent.</p>
<p>Most tax return preparers provide outstanding service, however, they have differing levels of skill, as well as continuing education requirements and expertise.</p>
<p>Preparers with<strong> unlimited</strong> representation rights can represent their clients on any matters – including audits, payment collection issues, and appeals.</p>
<p>Preparers with<strong> limited</strong> representation rights can only represent clients whose returns they have prepared and signed.</p>
<h2><strong>Credentialed Return Preparers</strong></h2>
<p>Tax return preparers with <strong>unlimited</strong> rights include professionals with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enrolled Agents: Licensed by the IRS. Must pass a three-part Special Enrollment Examination. This is a comprehensive exam that requires them to demonstrate proficiency in federal tax planning, individual and business tax return preparation, and representation.</li>
<li>Attorneys: Licensed by state courts. Attorneys have earned a degree in law and have passed a bar exam. They may offer a range of services, and some specialize in tax preparation and planning.</li>
<li>Certified Public Accountants: Licensed by state courts. CPAs have passed the Uniform CPA Examination. They have completed a study of accounting at a college or university. They may offer a range of services, and some specialize in tax preparation and planning.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><img class="alignright wp-image-3539" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/The-Taxpayer-Representative-woman-sitting-desk-journal-note-taking-now-what-help-sfs-tax.jpg" alt="The Taxpayer Representative, woman, sitting, desk, journal, note taking, now what help, sfs tax" width="517" height="363" /></strong>If you are dealing with an audit, you cannot just walk into any tax return preparers’ office. Only an Enrolled Agent, a CPA, or an attorney can help you with an IRS issue.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>“Ask what those initials mean in the big scheme toward solving your problem. After all, you’ll be on the boat together and entrusting him or her with your financial life. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>You deserve to be certain you have the right one before you turn over the controls.” </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Where to Research for Preparers</strong></h2>
<p>The IRS has a searchable, sortable public directory at <a href="https://irs.treasury.gov/rpo/rpo.jsf">https://irs.treasury.gov/rpo/rpo.jsf</a> to search for various tax preparers.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Forget 10,000 Leagues Under the Sea. You’ll have to dive much deeper than that to get to the heart of the IRS.</strong></h2>
<p>When it comes to the administration and enforcement of our tax system, there are four basic levels:</p>
<h2><strong><img class="wp-image-3636 size-full alignright" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Chapter-Meme-B-1.jpg" alt="" width="526" height="526" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Chapter-Meme-B-1.jpg 526w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Chapter-Meme-B-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Chapter-Meme-B-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Chapter-Meme-B-1-500x500.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px" /></strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Examinations (Audits)</li>
<li>Collections</li>
<li>Appeals</li>
<li>Criminal Investigations</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s time to talk about the first three.</p>
<h2><strong>Examinations (Audits) </strong></h2>
<p>When a return is filed and processed, it is automatically deemed correct unless the IRS computers find an error.</p>
<h3><strong>What types of errors are picked up by the computers?</strong></h3>
<p>If you understate the income reported, overreport expenses, or report you had health insurance when you did not, the computer spits out a notice showing what they have compared to what you’ve put on your return.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you’ll get selected for audit (done locally or by mail). The auditor can pick up on these same errors or omissions.</p>
<h2><strong>Collections</strong></h2>
<p>The Internal Revenue Service is the world’s largest and most aggressive collection agency. Even with their funding woes, they can and will come after you (either in person or by mail <a href="https://sfstaxacct.com/2019/04/2019-dirty-dozen-list-of-tax-scams/">– never a phone call or email.</a>)</p>
<h2><strong><img class="alignright wp-image-3638 " src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/You-Have-It-We-Want-It-sfs-now-what-help-courtroom-courthouse-outside-2.jpg" alt="" width="427" height="645" /></strong></h2>
<p>One of the IRS collection units is the Automated Collections Service, or ACS. They have various service centers around the country. Then, there are Settlement Officers. These officials are usually in the IRS Appeals Office.</p>
<h2><strong>Appeals </strong></h2>
<p>A taxpayer usually gets one shot at appeals. The next step is to prepare and file a tax court petition. Generally, you can file this once you receive a 90-day notice (Statutory Notice of Deficiency.) You can prepare the petition:</p>
<ul>
<li>yourself</li>
<li>by a U.S. Tax Court Practitioner</li>
<li>by an attorney licensed to practice in your state</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, there is a $60 fee. You will wait until your petition gets on the court docket. Then, it is assigned to an IRS lawyer. Most of the time, IRS attorneys will “send it back to appeals,” because most cases are not USTC worthy (i.e. not enough money).</p>
<p>If you do not want to go to court (it is not cheap unless you do it yourself, and that is not highly recommended) and you cannot/do not pay, that is the crux of this book.</p>
<p>Just as you have the right to appeal an IRS decision, you also have the right to be represented.</p>
