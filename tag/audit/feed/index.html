			<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Ten Commandments of an IRS Audit</h2>
<p>Behold, the IRS audit. They are rare these days. Only one out of every 184 taxpayers experienced an IRS audit in 2017, and less than a quarter of these audits are conducted in person by the IRS.</p>
<p>For many, navigating an IRS audit seems simple. Fortunately, most IRS audits are done by mail and are much less intrusive than the dreaded audit where the taxpayer personally meets with the IRS at their office (called an “office” or “desk” audit) or at the taxpayer’s home or place of business (called a “field” audit).</p>
<p>Nine out of 10 audits end in a change to the tax return. In mail audits, the additional amount owed averages around $6,790. For face-to-face audits, the cost is much higher — taxpayers owe an additional $77,309 on average from these audits. Mail audits are fairly simple — taxpayers simply need to respond timely, in writing, to prove a few line items on their return. For office and field audits, or if the taxpayer is disputing the IRS determination in an audit, they should ask a professional to intervene.</p>
<p>In the meantime, for the chosen few who must deal with an IRS audit, there are some do’s and don’ts to follow to successfully navigate an IRS audit — the Ten Commandments in handling an IRS audit.</p>
<h3>1. Thou shall not ignore thy auditor</h3>
<p>Ignoring an audit will not make it go away. In fact, it will do the opposite — the IRS will just proceed and assess additional tax on the areas that they want to audit on the tax return. In face-to-face audits, the IRS may ask third parties for information about the taxpayer, such as a bank to get information about the income the taxpayer receives or, if they are a small business, a vendor that supplies them with materials for the business. When the IRS requests information from a third party, they are usually trying to determine if the taxpayer is hiding income.</p>
<h3>2. Thou shall not bear false witness to the IRS auditor</h3>
<p>Never, never lie to the IRS. Lying to a federal agent is a crime. The taxpayer should present their facts to the IRS and their tax return position. If a taxpayer feels like they need to lie, that is a sure sign that they need to hire a tax professional to help.</p>
<h3>3. Contest thy wrath</h3>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-3884 size-medium" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Ten-Commandments-of-an-IRS-Audit-books-files-documents-binders-300x200.jpg" alt="Ten Commandments of an IRS Audit, books, files, documents, binders" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Ten-Commandments-of-an-IRS-Audit-books-files-documents-binders-300x200.jpg 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Ten-Commandments-of-an-IRS-Audit-books-files-documents-binders-768x512.jpg 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Ten-Commandments-of-an-IRS-Audit-books-files-documents-binders.jpg 1000w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Ten-Commandments-of-an-IRS-Audit-books-files-documents-binders-700x467.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>The IRS auditor does not have the final say. If there’s a disagreement on the facts or the application of the tax law, the taxpayer should exercise their right to appeal, and appeal the determination to the IRS Office of Appeals. A few months after the audit concludes, they will get to present their case to an independent person, called an Appeals officer, at the IRS and get a second opinion. If they don’t agree with the Appeals officer, they can take their tax dispute to court.</p>
<h3>4. Thou shall file all thy past-due tax returns without haste</h3>
<p>For taxpayers under audit, it is the IRS’s procedure to make sure that they have filed all required returns. It is never a good start with the auditor when they have not filed all required returns. The IRS will review, at a minimum, the past six years of filing history. If the taxpayer doesn’t file, the IRS auditor can file for them — called a substitute for return — and include no deductions, credits, or dependents.</p>
<h3>5. Thou shall come prepared to thy audit</h3>
<p>If the taxpayer is not prepared for the audit, they should be prepared for auditor skepticism and a long audit. For office and field audits, it is best to do a mock audit and know that income is properly reported and the auditor’s selected audit areas are properly reported. If the taxpayer cannot advocate for their tax return position from the start of the audit, they may get many more questions and requests for information from the auditor. The audit may even prematurely expand into other years because the auditor is suspicious that there is a problem.</p>
<h3>6. Thou shall elevate issues to thy auditor’s manager</h3>
<p>Audits should not feel like wandering the desert for 40 years. If the taxpayer doesn’t like how the audit is progressing, they should ask to speak to the auditor’s manager. In fact, they should always get the auditor’s and their manager’s contact information at the beginning of the audit in case they need to contact them. At any point that there’s a disagreement with the auditor, the manager is the first line of appeal. For example, if the auditor believes penalties apply, the taxpayer can ask the manager to hear their side of the case and intervene on their behalf. Few take advantage of the manager, and as a result, do not get a second opinion or intervention that could speed up the audit and get better results.</p>
<h3>7. ‘So let it be written, so let it be done’</h3>
<p>This is not a commandment, but in the 1956 movie “The Ten Commandments,” the pharaoh makes this proclamation many times. The rule in an audit is to get all requests for information in writing. Why? Auditors can get confused about the facts of the case if the taxpayer does not have a clear audit trail. Unclear facts lead to long audit. Take the lead in the audit, demand requests for information in writing and reply in writing. It will eliminate confusion and focus the audit on the issues in hand. Also, it will leave a written record of the facts that will be needed if the taxpayer wants to appeal the findings of the case.</p>
<h3>8. Remember and obey thy deadlines</h3>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-3883 size-medium" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Ten-Commandments-of-an-IRS-Audit-laptop-typing-communication-300x189.jpg" alt="Ten Commandments of an IRS Audit, laptop, typing, communication" width="300" height="189" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Ten-Commandments-of-an-IRS-Audit-laptop-typing-communication-300x189.jpg 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Ten-Commandments-of-an-IRS-Audit-laptop-typing-communication-768x485.jpg 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Ten-Commandments-of-an-IRS-Audit-laptop-typing-communication.jpg 1000w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Ten-Commandments-of-an-IRS-Audit-laptop-typing-communication-700x442.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>There are many deadlines in an audit — the audit appointment, deadlines to provide information, deadline to respond to the initial audit report, deadline to petition IRS appeals, and a deadline to petition the tax court, among others. When the taxpayer misses early deadlines in an audit, they put the auditor in a tight place. It is OK to delay one or maybe two meetings, but many missed deadlines and incomplete information means that the auditor will proceed to the next step: proposing adjustments to tax based on the taxpayer not meeting their burden of proof.</p>
<p>It is important to know that auditors have deadlines too. For face-to-face audits, a good rule of thumb is for the auditor to finish within one year. An open audit or an audit that is within a year of the statute of limitations expiring (three years from the due date of the return, or filing date, whichever is later) can mean trouble. Auditors and their managers like to close cases within two years after the filing of a return.</p>
<h3>9. Contest thy penalties</h3>
<p>Too often, taxpayers do not argue whether penalties apply. IRS auditors have been criticized for arbitrarily assessing penalties — namely the 20 percent accuracy penalty for negligence — in audits. Taxpayers should closely examine the facts and prepare to argue that penalties do not apply, and be prepared to explain the circumstances and prove to the IRS that they made a reasonable attempt to comply with the tax law, but were not able to because of unforeseen circumstances. For example, if they used a tax pro to file and their tax return position is being contested in the audit, they should highlight their reliance on the tax pro’s advice. In any event, they shouldn’t just concede — they should access the auditor’s manager and the IRS office of appeals if they need a second and third opinion.</p>
<h3>10. When in doubt, seek a higher authority</h3>
<p>Face-to-face audits require that the taxpayer “speak IRS.” They must know how to navigate the audit, their rights as a taxpayer, and how to advocate their tax return position. Unless they have experience and knowledge in handling an audit, they should seek the advice of a tax professional.</p>
<p>Professional representation in complex business audits can cost thousands. However, for most office audits, the tax pro will spend about two or three days in total in preparing for the audit, meeting with the IRS, and finalizing all matters of the audit. If the audit gets into multiple years, the time will increase. Tax pros should be able to offer a reasonable range of fees to expect before the taxpayer engages their assistance.<br />

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Will My Income Tax Return be Audited?</strong></h1>
<p>For the vast majority of taxpayers, there is not much need to worry that you will be audited. In 2016, only 0.6% of individual income tax returns were audited according to the IRS <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/17databk.pdf">2017 Data Book</a>. Why? For starters, after the IRS budget cuts, we lost 2,200 agents that previously audited returns.</p>
<p>The “real” audit rate, however, is closer to 7.0%. The IRS does not include the over 9.2 million notices that are questioning items on your client’s tax returns (such as forgetting to include a 1099-Misc form).  The IRS is relying more and more on technology to uncover underreporting and underpayment of taxes.</p>
<p>The following are the different taxpayer groups are more susceptible to catching the attention of auditors.</p>
<p><img class="alignright  wp-image-2350" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Will-My-Income-Tax-Return-be-Audited-atlas-map-international-countries.jpg" alt="Will My Income Tax Return be Audited?" width="276" height="181" /></p>
<h3>Returns that report more than $10 Million in income or report no income</h3>
<p>Sixteen percent of individuals who reported over $10 million in income were audited in 2014. Surprisingly, the IRS audited those returns at a higher rate than those that reported no income.</p>
<p>The IRS audited 5.3% of tax returns with no income in 2014. If your income is $25,000 &#8211; $200,000, it is unlikely that you will be singled out for an audit.</p>
<h3><strong>Estate Tax Returns of More than $5 Million</strong></h3>
<p>In 2014, the IRS did an audit on 8.5% of estate tax returns which was well above the .9% of individual returns. 21% of even larger estate tax returns (between $5 million to $10 million) were audited, while 27% of those over $10 million received an audit.</p>
<h3><strong>Individual Filing of International Returns Raises a Red Flag</strong></h3>
<p>The IRS is focusing more attention on international returns. Statements made by experts in the field, strongly emphasized the practice of <a href="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/irs-forces-full-disclosure-for-overseas-accounts/">offshore tax evasion</a> as being fundamentally unfair. Wealthy people evading the law by stashing their money overseas and not paying their share of tax is forcing the bulk of lower income citizens to foot the bill to fund the government. In 2014, they audited 4.8% of international returns.</p>
<h3><strong>Errors in Information Entered</strong></h3>
<p>If someone filling out income tax forms makes simple, careless mistakes, red flags go up to the tax auditors. Filers neglect to get all report forms and statements together and forget to report dependents and exemptions correctly. The automated systems recognize these discrepancies, but can&#8217;t tell if they are actual mistakes or intentional. <a href="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/how-to-avoid-being-audited/">Neglecting to report all your income</a> and other figures could result in an audit especially at higher incomes. Those who contribute to more charities and other organizations open up the possibility for fraud.</p>
<h3><strong>Reports of Unrealistic Itemized Deductions<img class="alignright  wp-image-2351" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Will-My-Income-Tax-Return-be-Audited-finance-sheet-apple-coffee-camera-cactus.jpg" alt="Will My Income Tax Return be Audited, finance, sheet, apple, coffee, camera, cactus" width="355" height="234" /></strong></h3>
<p>An individual or small business could be signaled out for an audited if they claim itemized deductions that are clearly out of line. Filers need to know what a legitimate deduction entails.</p>
<p>Carefully reading directions for completing forms and checking for accuracy and honesty will reduce the chances of an audit. Hiring a tax professional, specifically someone with tax resolution experience like our firm, can help you stay out of tax trouble.</p>

<p>No one wants to be audited by the IRS. But it happens.</p>
<p>One of the top questions taxpayers consistently ask is how to avoid an audit.</p>
<h2>The short answer is: You may not be able to avoid an audit</h2>
<p>The best you can do is to be honest and turn in a return that reflects that.</p>
<p>Now, ignorance is no excuse. If you actually owe more than indicated on your return, you will be held accountable for that. Don’t be afraid to get professional help to make sure you file correctly each year.</p>
<h3>It is possible to go through life without being audited though<img class="wp-image-1138 alignright" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Best-Steps-to-Take-to-Avoid-an-Audit-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Billboard-Less-Stress-This-Way-300x181.png" alt="Best Steps to Take to Avoid an Audit" width="424" height="256" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Best-Steps-to-Take-to-Avoid-an-Audit-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Billboard-Less-Stress-This-Way-300x181.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Best-Steps-to-Take-to-Avoid-an-Audit-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Billboard-Less-Stress-This-Way-768x464.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Best-Steps-to-Take-to-Avoid-an-Audit-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Billboard-Less-Stress-This-Way-700x423.png 700w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Best-Steps-to-Take-to-Avoid-an-Audit-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Billboard-Less-Stress-This-Way.png 879w" sizes="(max-width: 424px) 100vw, 424px" /></h3>
<p>That’s because in any given year, less than one percent of returns are audited. So with 250 million adults in the US, odds are in your favor.</p>
<p>There are things that can make you more likely to be audited.</p>
<p>There are also steps that help avoid the possibility of it happening, and, if it does, to mitigate the likelihood you will owe back taxes (and penalties and interest as the cherries on top).</p>
<p>However it would be irresponsible to even hint that there is some way to guarantee you won’t be audited.</p>
<p>Why? Because one of the three ways the IRS [link to IRS.gov] chooses those returns to audit is random.</p>
<p>That’s right, random luck of the draw!</p>
<h3>Asking how to avoid an audit is the wrong question to ask</h3>
<p>The right question is, “How do I make my return audit-proof?”</p>
<p>“Sometimes you can’t avoid an audit,” says Jeffrey Schneider, author of <em>Now What? I Got a Tax Notice from the IRS. Help!</em> “Prepare your return with that in mind.”</p>
<p>Keep your documentation.</p>
<p>Only take deductions you are entitled to (and for the amount you are entitled to).</p>
<p>Don’t forget about the alternative minimum tax! Make sure you are not subject to it each year.</p>
<p>Finally, if you do get audited, don’t feel as though you have to go it alone. You have every right to hire an Enrolled Agent to represent you. EAs are the only federally licensed tax practitioners who specialize in taxation and have unlimited rights to represent taxpayers before the IRS.</p>
