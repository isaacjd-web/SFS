<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Seth Rogen Launches “Houseplant” – A Cannabis Company</strong></h1>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-3653 " src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Seth-Rogen-Launches-Houseplant-A-Cannabis-Company-plant-cannabusiness-1.jpg" alt="" width="325" height="507" /></p>
<p>Comedian Seth Rogen and filmmaker Evan Goldberg are getting into the recreational cannabis business. On Wednesday, March 27<sup>th</sup>, they announced the launch of their brand <a href="https://www.houseplant.com/">Houseplant</a> in Canada. The new company is a partnership with global cannabis firm <a href="https://www.canopygrowth.com/investors/news-releases/canopy-growth-welcomes-houseplant-to-the-family/">Canopy Growth</a> and will “make it easier for people to learn to love cannabis as much as Houseplant does,” according to a press release from the company.</p>
<p>“Houseplant is a passion we’ve brought to life through drive and dedication,” <a href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/welcome-to-houseplant-an-elevated-canadian-cannabis-company-866891919.html">said Rogen</a>, a longtime <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/cannabis/">cannabis</a> advocate and star of the movies “Pineapple Express” and “Superbad,” both collaborations with Goldberg. “Every decision we’ve made for the business reflects the years of education, first-hand experience, and respect we have for cannabis.”</p>
<h2><strong>Mark Zekulin</strong><strong>, President and Co-CEO of Canopy Growth, expressed high hopes for the future of the new company. </strong></h2>
<p>“We have been getting to know the Houseplant team for quite a while now and continue to be impressed by their understanding of the cannabis consumer, attention to detail, and drive towards their vision,” said Zekulin. “We could not be more excited to partner with them and work towards our shared goal of making Houseplant one of the largest cannabis brands in the world.”</p>
<p>Canopy Growth will bring its advanced production infrastructure and research capabilities to the partnership, supporting the vision of Houseplant. Canopy Growth is a leading producer of cannabis and cannabis products in Canada. It has operations in 12 countries on five continents. The company also has a marketing arrangement with hip-hop icon Snoop Dogg. Furthermore, they recently announced a new line of hemp CBD products developed in collaboration with homemaker extraordinaire and media mogul Martha Stewart.</p>
<h2><strong>Three Strains on the Way </strong></h2>
<p>Houseplant plans to release three cannabis strains “designed to satisfy both expert and new users” in Canada in the upcoming months. They&#8217;re hoping “to ensure an intuitive shopping and consuming experience for customers.” The first, Houseplant Sativa, will be available beginning next month through provincially regulated retailers and online in British Columbia. It will be followed by Houseplant Hybrid and Houseplant Indica, with each strain having its own easily identifiable design.</p>
<h2><strong><img class="alignright wp-image-3654 " src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Seth-Rogen-Launches-Houseplant-A-Cannabis-Company-tray-tea-flower-1.jpg" alt="" width="399" height="644" /></strong></h2>
<p>The company will soon offer dried cannabis flower, soft-gel <a href="https://hightimes.com/health/what-exactly-are-thc-pills/">capsules</a>, and pre-rolled joints nationwide and will be operated in Toronto. Houseplant “is dedicated to quality, education, guidance, and elevation of cannabis to enhance the lives of Canadians.”</p>
<p>“We are so proud to be launching in Canada, our home,” said Goldberg. “After spending five years diligently preparing for the launch of this company, we’re excited to be able to share our passion for cannabis with Canadians in this way.”</p>

<p>1. A company name that gives you room to grow and expand your product line.</p>
<p>2. Where will the business be located? Will the landlord be <a href="http://time.com/4292844/420-april-20-marijuana-pot-holiday-history/">420</a>-business-friendly? Your local legal restrictions vary so check before you set up shop.</p>
<p>3. How will you do your banking and pay the bills? Federal law generally prohibits banks from working with companies that buy or sell marijuana, so options are limited. How will you manage security and accountability for the cash changing hands?</p>
<p>4. What does the law require at your physical location? Opaque windows for pot shops, video cameras and video storage for growers, a “quarantine area” for edibles before they are shipped out, or participation in seed-to-sale tracking systems?</p>
<p>5. How will you share the news about your new business? State laws generally prohibit TV, radio, billboard and social media advertising, and advertising vehicles like coupons and event sponsorship are severely restricted.</p>
<p>6. How will you manage the tax implications? Taxes must be paid on all income, and most business expenses related to cannabis are disqualified from your deductions.</p>
<p>7. Will you hire employees who are experts in marijuana and what if they bring a related criminal record with them? Will you establish your company culture to accept employee marijuana use, but totally distinguishes that use and its effects from the workplace?</p>

			<p>8. Who will promote the cannabis industry interests? The legal marijuana industry is expanding with new “organizations, “and “associations” that claim to represent and promote marijuana interests. Without much of a track record, it’s hard to know which one to join and support.</p>
<p>9. Will your business remain legal? There remains a risk of prosecution under federal law regardless of state legality.</p>
<p>10. When will the big box stores jump in? Large drugstore chains, warehouse stores, cigarette companies and others are currently prohibited from entering the fractured market, but that could happen when the industry normalizes nationally and forces out small guy.</p>
