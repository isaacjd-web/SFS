								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><em>What Can a Tax Professional Do for You that an Online Tax Program Can’t?  </em><em>An SFS Tax Problem Solutions Blog.</em></p>
<h1>What Can a Tax Professional Do for You that an Online Tax Program Can’t?</h1>
<p>Why do self-checkout lines at Walmart need cashiers to stand by?</p>
<p>Why do we keep pressing “0” for the operator when faced with an automated voice system?</p>
<p>Why do we hang up instead of leaving a voicemail?</p>
<p>It’s because sometimes you just need a human.</p>
<p>Raymond Kurzweil is the author of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Intelligent_Machines">The Age of Intelligent Machines</a> (1990). He predicted that computers would outsmart the human brain by mid-21st century.<br />
That’s only 32 years away.</p>
<p>Well, based on what I’ve seen, I don’t think it’s going to happen. And even so, it’s a long wait to be able to turn your life over to a machine!</p>

<h2>What a Tax Professional Can Do for You that an Online Program Can’t – It’s Called a Brain</h2>
<p>The problem is that no one has ever been able to recreate the human brain.</p>
<p>And I’m betting no one will ever do so.</p>
<p>Computers can make our lives easier, to be sure.</p>
<p>It’s wonderful having Google at your fingertips to answer any questions you dream up. It’s convenient to snap a photo of the grandkids and carry it around with you on your phone. It’s easier to write that novel typing on a keyboard than writing it out longhand.</p>
<p>But what those nifty machines can’t do is think critically.</p>
<h2><img class="size-medium wp-image-1605 alignleft" src="https://sfstaxacct.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pexels-photo-327533-300x188.jpeg" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" srcset="https://sfstaxacct.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pexels-photo-327533-300x188.jpeg 300w, https://sfstaxacct.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pexels-photo-327533.jpeg 559w" alt="A Tax Professional Can Help You Avoid Having to Owe Back Taxes, Penalties &amp; Interest" width="300" height="188" />What a Tax Professional Can Do for You that an Online Tax Program Can’t – Catch Your Mistakes Before they Become Delinquent Tax Bills</h2>
<p>Computers can’t tell if the information you found online is accurate or from a reliable source.</p>
<p>They can’t tell you that you didn’t include the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/090415/are-dividends-considered-passive-or-ordinary-income.asp">dividends from the stock</a> that your Aunt Mary left you on your tax return.</p>
<p>And they can’t tell the difference between the transposed numbers you entered for last year’s income versus the real deal.</p>
<p>It’s garbage in, garbage out.</p>
<p>Computers have their uses… and their downfalls as well.</p>
<p>And even though may be a mistake, but the IRS can still tack penalties and interest onto your mistakes.</p>
<p>Like a warm hug and great conversation, there are just some things you need a human for. Taxes are one of those things!</p>
