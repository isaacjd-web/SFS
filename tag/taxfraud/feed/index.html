<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Shakira Pays $25 Million in Back Taxes</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://people.com/tag/shakira/">Shakira</a> has reportedly paid a major bill for back taxes owed to the Spanish government.</p>
<p>According to numerous reports, this international superstar has paid more than 20 million Euros &#8211; or $25 million &#8211; to the Spanish authorities to settle part of a tax fraud debt pending ongoing investigation.</p>
<p>The investigation seeks to establish whether Shakira legally resided in Spain with her longtime boyfriend, Barcelona Futbol Club soccer player Gerard Piqué, between the years 2011 and 2014.<img class="alignright  wp-image-2302" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Shakira-Pays-25-Million-in-Back-Taxes.jpg" alt="Shakira Pays $25 Million in Back Taxes, Barcelona, architecture, building, ancient" width="303" height="265" /></p>
<p>Spanish law states that if an individual spends more than 183 days in the country, they are considered a legal resident and liable for paying taxes on income acquired internationally. However, those spending fewer than 183 days in Spain would only be accountable for income earned within the country.</p>
<h3>The Defense Has Spoken</h3>
<p>Shakira, 41, reportedly claimed that she had spent the majority of those years as a resident of the Bahamas. She claims to have filed her taxes accordingly. In documents obtained by both <em>El Periodico</em> and <em>El Pais,</em> the singer’s defense claimed that she had indeed spent most of her time abroad, and made no effort to intentionally hide her income, citing any misunderstandings as “a difference in criteria.”</p>
<p>It was confirmed that in 2009, Shakira relocated her intellectual property rights and brands to a company based in Malta. Malta is known for and has faced allegations of being a tax heaven.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-2301" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Shakira-Pays-25-Million-in-Back-Taxes-shakira-court-courtroom-stressed.jpg" alt="Shakira Pays $25 Million in Back Taxes, shakira, court, courtroom, stressed" width="270" height="176" />Spanish press reports have detailed extensive efforts of local tax authorities to establish Shakira’s place of residence during the years in question. They’ve begun studying photos of the star out and about in Spain to piece together her story. They even interviewed her hairstylist.</p>
<p>Shakira’s reported payment covers the amount owed for 2011, while the investigation into taxes owed for 2012-2014 remains ongoing, <em>El Periodico </em>claims. Once completed, the district attorney and the Agencia Estatal de Administración Tributaria (Spanish Tax Agency; their equivalence of our Internal Revenue Service) are expected to decide if tax fraud charges will be brought. Then, the case will proceed to court.</p>
<h3><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h3>
<p>If she did commit tax fraud, Shakira would join a <a href="https://www.thetaxdefensegroup.com/five-famous-people-who-committed-tax-fraud/">list</a> of celebrities who have been in trouble with tax authorities.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Miami-Dade Police Officer Arrested for Stealing Thousands in Federal Funds While in College</strong></h2>
<p>Ebony Nesbitt’s tax fraud past may have caught up with her. Fraudulent tax refunds are practically unforgivable with the IRS. If she is convicted, the choices she made in college will severely impact her future.  She was relieved of duty without pay from the Miami-Dade Police Force and may serve up to 15 years in prison.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-1921" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Miami-Dade-Police-Officer-Arrested-for-Stealing-Thousands-in-Federal-Funds-While-in-College-girl-college-library.jpg" alt="Miami-Dade Police Officer Arrested for Stealing Thousands in Federal Funds While in College, girl, college, library" width="269" height="200" /></p>
<p>When Nesbitt was attending Miami-Dade College in 2013, federal prosecutors say she joined a ring of students who stole other people&#8217;s identities to file fake tax returns seeking nearly $2 million in refunds. Nesbitt and many others received thousands of dollars in their college bank accounts.</p>
<p>She was not among the 18 MDC students arrested in 2014 as the U.S. attorney&#8217;s office froze more than 1,000 student bank accounts used to deposit fraudulently obtained tax refunds. The ring filed returns in the names of about 650 taxpayers whose Social Security numbers were stolen. As a result, the IRS issued almost $500,000 in refunds.</p>
<p>Four years after the college scandal, Nesbitt serves as a Miami-Dade police officer. But not for long, because the 28-year-old North Miami woman was arrested. She received charges of a conspiracy against the U.S. government and theft of federal funds.</p>
<h3><strong>Results Pending</strong></h3>
<p>They released Nesbitt on a $50,000 bond. The police force also relieved her of duty without pay pending the outcome of her criminal case. Nesbitt joined the police force in 2014 and sadly enough, this was not her first time in the news.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-1919" title="Miami-Dade Police Officer Arrested for Stealing Thousands in Federal Funds While in College, court, judge, gavel" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Miami-Dade-Police-Officer-Arrested-for-Stealing-Thousands-in-Federal-Funds-While-in-College-court-judge-gavel.jpg" alt="Miami-Dade Police Officer Arrested for Stealing Thousands in Federal Funds While in College, court, judge, gavel" width="164" height="197" />The case by the FBI and U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office was made as the statute of limitations was going to expire. In a separate but recent incident, Nesbitt&#8217;s former boyfriend, Andrew Morales, was charged with two counts of theft of government funds. Morales received two electronic tax refunds from the Treasury Department. He received $7,568 and $9,353 &#8211; both in the names of other people. Seems a little fishy…</p>
<h3><strong>How She Did It</strong></h3>
<p>Nesbitt and her co-conspirators obtained the names, dates of birth and Social Security numbers of other people for filing bogus tax returns &#8211; then arranged to have the electronic refunds deposited into the Higher One bank accounts of Miami Dade College students. Those accounts are for receiving financial aid and paying tuition.</p>
<p>Nesbitt and her co-conspirators &#8220;designated&#8221; her Higher One account for the direct deposit of federal tax refunds. On Oct. 2, 2013, Nesbitt&#8217;s account received a wire transfer totaling $7,573 from the Treasury Department in the name of another person.</p>
<p>That same day, an unnamed co-conspirator withdrew about $502 from Nesbitt&#8217;s Higher One account. She used a debit card in her name. Eight days later, Nesbitt received a check totaling $7,068.50 from Higher One when the banking-service company closed her Miami Dade College account.</p>
