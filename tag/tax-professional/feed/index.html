<p>Though our firm specializes in helping people resolve their IRS or state back tax problems, we also love saving you money. After all, one of the best ways to avoid getting into tax trouble is to minimize your liabilities.</p>
<h2><strong><img class="alignright wp-image-2683" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Year-End-Tax-Saving-Strategies-girl-writing-sticky-notes.jpg" alt="" width="374" height="223" /></strong></h2>
<p>The end of the year is the perfect time to review your finances and the perfect time to make some smart tax-saving moves. Making the right moves at the end of the year can possibly reduce your tax liability and allow you to keep more of what you earn.</p>
<p>From accelerating expenses to boosting the amount you put away for retirement, there are things you can do to lower your tax burden. You may not be able to control the tax fight in Washington, but you can limit the amount you pay by assessing your own tax situation and making some prudent changes.</p>
<h2><strong>Accelerate Your Expenses</strong></h2>
<p>Individual taxpayers are on the cash basis for income tax purposes. This means your income is taxable when you receive it and expenses count when you pay them. Depending on your situation, shifting deductions between years can make a big difference on your tax bill. With this knowledge, making additional deductible payments prior to the end of the year may be a good idea. Examples include property tax payments, mortgage interest payments, and charitable donations.</p>
<h2><strong>Boost Your 401(k) Contributions </strong></h2>
<h2><strong><img class="alignright wp-image-2684" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Year-End-Tax-Saving-Strategies-girl-writing-white-board.jpg" alt="Year-End Tax Saving Strategies, girl, writing, white board" width="604" height="903" /></strong></h2>
<p>As the year ticks down to its close, it pays to look at your most recent pay stub and see how much you have already contributed to your 401(k) plan. Contributing to a 401(k) plan is an excellent way to save on taxes since every dollar you put in is deducted from your taxable income.</p>
<p>For 2018, you can contribute up to $18,500 to your 401(k) plan, plus an extra 6,000  if you are 50 or older. Also, if you have not yet maxed out your 401(k), now is the perfect time to boost your contributions and make up for lost time.  Keep in mind that many companies allow you to change your contribution percentage any time you wish. Boosting the amount you put in between now and the end of the year can make a huge difference. You can adjust your contribution downward in the new year if you wish, but at least consider leaving it at its new elevated level.</p>
<h2><strong>Gather Your Donations</strong></h2>
<p style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 200%; font-family: 'Microsoft Sans Serif','sans-serif';">Donating to charity makes you feel good, but it can also be good for your wallet. If you itemize your deductions, you may be able to take a deduction for not only cash contributions but gifts of household goods and clothing as well.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 200%; font-family: 'Microsoft Sans Serif','sans-serif';">Take a few minutes this weekend to go through your closets and storage areas. First, look for usable items you no longer need. Box them up and take them down to your local thrift store or other charity. Be sure to get a receipt that shows what you donated, along with the approximate value. </span></p>
<h2><strong>Contact Your Enrolled Agent</strong></h2>
<p style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 200%; font-family: 'Microsoft Sans Serif','sans-serif';">This is a short list of some of the ideas you can use to lower your tax obligation in 2018. If you need an expert tax resolution professional, reach out to us and we’ll schedule a no-obligation confidential consultation. Jeffrey Schneider, EA, CTRS will explain your options and help permanently resolve your tax problem.</span></p>

<p>Cannabis, Marijuana, Weed, Pot, Mary Jane &#8211; a rose by any other name is still a rose.  No matter what you want to call it, the industry surrounding this drug faces many uphill battles.  It does not matter if you grow it, cultivate it, distribute it or dispense it, if you are in this industry or are looking to become part of the industry, you have tax and accounting issues that most businesses would not and could not imagine.</p>
<p>First and foremost, no matter what your state says (more on that later), Cannabis is an illegal drug for federal purposes. There are 5 categories in which drugs are lumped.  Heroin and LSD, as one might expect is placed in the first category.  You must be thinking “What does these two dangerous and addictive drugs have to do with pot?”  Well, a lot.  In fact, marijuana has been placed in this category and is considered a dangerous drug.</p>
<p>That’s the federal government for you.  It is a political hotbed, to say the list.  However, we will not go there, as this not a political blog.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-1594 alignleft" title="Cannabis Taxation Controversy and Confusion, where is marijuana legal, what states can use cannabis" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/map.png" alt="" width="361" height="258" /></p>
<p>Now what about all the states?  44 states, including Washington DC and Guam have individually legalized the use of marijuana in some form or another.  The use ranges from medical to recreational to growing.  Each state passed their own laws, their own regulations and their own procedures on how to control the industry in their state.</p>
<h4><strong>Controversy: Federal Law vs. State Law</strong></h4>
<p>So how does this conflict between the Federal government and the states co-exist?  Well, the federal government has indicated that they will not crack down on these businesses. That does not mean they won’t.  In fact, in a recent tax case, part of the issue was the deductibility of over $600,000 worth of product confiscated by the Feds… it wasn’t allowed as a deduction. It is, after all, illegal as far as the Federal government is concerned.</p>
<p>Now, when it comes to taxes &#8211; for Federal tax purposes, the IRS, because it is an illegal business endeavor, will not allow for any tax deductions (deductible expense) against the income generated by this business.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1593 " title="Cannabis Taxation Controversy and Confusion, Al Capone, Al Capone Quotes, City" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Al-Capone-Quote.jpg" alt="" width="436" height="199" /></p>
<h4><strong>So Why Report it on my Federal Income Tax Return?</strong></h4>
<p>You may not be aware, that there is an Internal Revenue Code Section (61) that, very specifically states, that all income is taxable from whatever source derived.  Think of Al Capone.  What was he sent to prison for?  Murder? Prostitution? Bootlegging?  Not a chance.  It was tax evasion.  He never reported his illegally received gains on a tax return.</p>
<p>So what happens to these businesses that are operating illegally for federal purposes, but legally for state?  Well, they better be reporting their gross income on the appropriate individual corporate or partnership tax return.  Oh, yes, trusts and estates can be involved, too.</p>
<p>How about deductions since it is mentioned that the IRS will not allow any deduction?  Congress enacted Internal Revenue Code Section 280E to get people to file returns and report this income, even if it’s considered illegal income.  This section says that cost of goods sold will be allowed as a <em><strong>reduction</strong></em> (not <strong>deduction</strong>) against gross sales. Semantics?  Maybe, but the courts have ruled that cost of goods sold is an adjustment in arriving at net sales. Remember, a rose by any other name…..?  Whatever reason, it helps.  Not entirely, but it helps.</p>
<p>But you can’t just call something “cost of goods” to reduce your taxes. There are very specific rules to follow… with court cases to back them up.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, in most cases, you cannot open a bank account if you are affiliated with this industry. This means you have to deal with cash, cannot take credit cards and cannot deposit the wads of cash you carry into a bank.  You better have a very large, very secure safe.</p>
<p>If you have employees, you have to pay them in cash.  For those of you that have payroll, you may know that you are required to make your payroll tax deposits electronically. This enlies the next question:</p>
<p><em><strong>How Can We Do This Without a Bank Account?</strong></em></p>
<p>This will be one of your biggest challenges, especially when the IRS can penalize you for not making these deposits electronically.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-1595" title="Cannabis Taxation Controversy and Confusion, frog, growers, distributors" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/frog-cannabis-clones-sm.jpg" alt="" width="435" height="356" /></p>
<p>To fight this, you need to make sure that you have a professional that understands the nuances of 280E, how to set up your business when you may have an ancillary shop (i.e., one that offers counseling, munchies, or even paraphernalia) and to handle any issues that arise with the IRS or the state.  The states, like Colorado, have indicated that they WILL audit every business every few years and they have. Not for the reason you may think why a business may get audited, but for licensing reasons.  The IRS will also come in to audit a business to question as to what went into the 280E numbers claimed on the return.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Schneider, EA, CTRS has trained and learned what each business needs to pass muster.  He has read the statutes, regulations and court cases to help you muddle through the mind field of this industry.  In fact, Schneider travels the country teaching other tax pros on this subject.</p>
<p>So if you are a part of &#8211; or thinking of getting into &#8211; the cannabis industry, find a pro that knows this industry well. If you are thinking about starting a sidekick business as was mentioned before, make sure your pro understand how to get the most out of 280E.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Debt can be a dark cloud that hangs over everything you do. When it comes to taxes, it’s that much worse. The more you ignore a tax debt, the bigger the debt gets, as penalties and interest are added on. Not only that, the IRS has the power to assess <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_lien">tax liens</a> against your personal property and even levy your bank account or garnish your wages.</p>
<p>If this is you… take heart!</p>
<h3><strong>You Can Make a Fresh Start </strong></h3>
<p>The IRS has a Fresh Start program that launched 10 years ago in the midst of a biting economic recession. Designed to make paying your back taxes and avoiding tax liens easier, it has been expanded over the years. The program has helped people around the country get back on their feet.</p>
<p>Knowing exactly where you stand makes it easier to come to a resolution that will satisfy the IRS and allow you to move on with your life…minus one dark cloud. We recommend retaining a professional in dealing with these issues.</p>
<h3><strong>Greater Access to Installment Agreements </strong></h3>
<p>Sometimes you can’t pay what you owe all at once. The IRS offers installment agreements for this purpose.</p>
<p>What if you can’t pay the monthly amount the IRS wants?</p>
<p>Don’t despair.</p>
<p>There are options.</p>
<h3><strong>IRS Tax Liens Minimum Raised</strong></h3>
<p>The program increased to $10,000 the amount you must owe before a tax lien can be filed. The IRS may still file a tax lien notice for an amount less than the $10,000 at its discretion, however.</p>
<p>One important feature of the Fresh Start program is that the tax lien may be withdrawn if you meet certain conditions, including paying off your tax debt.  You may also qualify if you are paying your debt through a Direct Debit installment agreement.</p>
<p>However, if you then default on your installment agreement the IRS can file another tax lien.</p>
<h3><strong>Greater Flexibility when Considering Offers in Compromise</strong></h3>
<p>The IRS will analyze your ability to pay when considering whether to agree to allow you to settle your tax debt for less than the full amount. The Fresh Start program gave the IRS more flexibility when analyzing that ability.</p>
<p>If they believe you can pay in full within a reasonable amount of time, it will probably not be accepted. The IRS looks at your income, assets, and other factors in determining your ability to pay.</p>
<p>Did we make it sound easy? It’s not. It’s a lot of work and it takes time for the taxpayer and their representative. Don’t do this alone.</p>
<p>Whatever your tax situation may be, we can help. We have 35 years of experience helping people just like you deal with the IRS. Give us a call at (772) 337-1040 or <a href="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/contact-us-at-sfs-tax-problem-solutions-in-port-st-lucie/">make an appointment online today</a>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><em>What Can a Tax Professional Do for You that an Online Tax Program Can’t?  </em><em>An SFS Tax Problem Solutions Blog.</em></p>
<h1>What Can a Tax Professional Do for You that an Online Tax Program Can’t?</h1>
<p>Why do self-checkout lines at Walmart need cashiers to stand by?</p>
<p>Why do we keep pressing “0” for the operator when faced with an automated voice system?</p>
<p>Why do we hang up instead of leaving a voicemail?</p>
<p>It’s because sometimes you just need a human.</p>
<p>Raymond Kurzweil is the author of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Intelligent_Machines">The Age of Intelligent Machines</a> (1990). He predicted that computers would outsmart the human brain by mid-21st century.<br />
That’s only 32 years away.</p>
<p>Well, based on what I’ve seen, I don’t think it’s going to happen. And even so, it’s a long wait to be able to turn your life over to a machine!</p>

<h2>What a Tax Professional Can Do for You that an Online Program Can’t – It’s Called a Brain</h2>
<p>The problem is that no one has ever been able to recreate the human brain.</p>
<p>And I’m betting no one will ever do so.</p>
<p>Computers can make our lives easier, to be sure.</p>
<p>It’s wonderful having Google at your fingertips to answer any questions you dream up. It’s convenient to snap a photo of the grandkids and carry it around with you on your phone. It’s easier to write that novel typing on a keyboard than writing it out longhand.</p>
<p>But what those nifty machines can’t do is think critically.</p>
<h2><img class="size-medium wp-image-1605 alignleft" src="https://sfstaxacct.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pexels-photo-327533-300x188.jpeg" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" srcset="https://sfstaxacct.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pexels-photo-327533-300x188.jpeg 300w, https://sfstaxacct.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pexels-photo-327533.jpeg 559w" alt="A Tax Professional Can Help You Avoid Having to Owe Back Taxes, Penalties &amp; Interest" width="300" height="188" />What a Tax Professional Can Do for You that an Online Tax Program Can’t – Catch Your Mistakes Before they Become Delinquent Tax Bills</h2>
<p>Computers can’t tell if the information you found online is accurate or from a reliable source.</p>
<p>They can’t tell you that you didn’t include the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/090415/are-dividends-considered-passive-or-ordinary-income.asp">dividends from the stock</a> that your Aunt Mary left you on your tax return.</p>
<p>And they can’t tell the difference between the transposed numbers you entered for last year’s income versus the real deal.</p>
<p>It’s garbage in, garbage out.</p>
<p>Computers have their uses… and their downfalls as well.</p>
<p>And even though may be a mistake, but the IRS can still tack penalties and interest onto your mistakes.</p>
<p>Like a warm hug and great conversation, there are just some things you need a human for. Taxes are one of those things!</p>
