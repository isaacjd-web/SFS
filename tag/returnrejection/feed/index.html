								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #000000;">In part one of this series, we talked about the case of John Spottiswood and his TurboTax return.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Back in April 2013, John Spottiswood filed his 2012, along with the $395,619 in taxes due, via TurboTax. When TurboTax submitted the return to the IRS, it was rejected. Spottiswood was unaware of the rejection and did not discover it until 18 months later when he logged into his 2012 TurboTax software. The result? The IRS slapped an estimated nearly $200,000 in penalties plus interest.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Spottiswood took his case to court.</span></p>
<h3><strong><img class="wp-image-1885 size-full alignright" src="https://sfstaxacct.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Courts-Decision-TurboTax-Not-to-Blame-for-Taxpayers-Submitted-Return-Rejection-Taxpayer-on-the-Hook-for-an-Estimated-200000-in-Penalties-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-shocked-cute-animal.png" alt="" width="486" height="438" /><span style="color: #000000;">Interest and Penalties? </span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Interestingly, Spottiswood did not fight the IRS on the interest. However, he requested that the penalties – both the late filing and late payment penalties, which could total nearly $200,000 over 18 months </span>–<span style="color: #000000;"> be abated.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">His reasoning was that he was unaware that there was even a possibility that his return filed with TurboTax could be rejected.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“Intuit may have informed me in the fine print that I needed to log back in to make sure that my return had not been rejected, but if so I did not read this fine print,” said Spottiswood in a statement to the IRS.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>(Not a Satisfactory) Outcome </strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In the end, TurboTax was found not to be to blame for the Spottiswood’s late filing or late payment of their 2012 taxes.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The court sided with the IRS in upholding all penalties, so those will come out of the Spottiswood’s pockets.</span></p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-1886 alignleft" src="https://sfstaxacct.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Courts-Decision-TurboTax-Not-to-Blame-for-Taxpayers-Submitted-Return-Rejection-Taxpayer-on-the-Hook-for-an-Estimated-200000-in-Penalties-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-wrong-way-sign-300x176.png" alt="Courts Decision, TurboTax Not to Blame for Taxpayers Submitted Return Rejection, Taxpayer on the Hook for an Estimated 200000 in Penalties, SFS Tax Problem Solutions, wrong way sign" width="300" height="176" /><span style="color: #000000;">This is a key difference between using an online tax system versus a qualified professional such as an Enrolled Agent (EA). Your EA will file your return directly with the IRS and follow up to make sure it was accepted. If not, they (or their staff) will continue contacting you until the return is corrected and filed.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Lesson Learned</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">First, it pays to have a professional on your side when it comes to taxes. Had the Spottiswoods consulted an EA, their return would not have been filed late. Second, if you do have to go up against the IRS, as the Spottiswoods did, the expert advice of an EA is invaluable.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">With cases such as these, there are circumstances under which some (or all) or those penalties could be abated. As a tax professional who must meet stringent requirements and continue their study of tax law, EAs know all of the rules and the ways to help taxpayers in trouble.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">However, if you don’t receive that advice, you won’t be aware of it and use it to your advantage.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">What you don’t know can hurt you… big time. The Spottiswoods found out the hard way. Learn from their example and don’t let this happen to you!</span></p>
