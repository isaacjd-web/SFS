<p>Did you know, as a taxpayer, you have your own Bill of Rights? The IRS has adopted a Taxpayer Bill of Rights for all of their dealings with the IRS. Chapter 5 of <em>Now What? The IRS is Taking Everything I Own. Help!</em> goes over all ten and what they mean for you. We put together a little summary.</p>
<h2><strong>I. The Right to Be Informed</strong></h2>
<p>Taxpayers have the right to know what they need to do to comply with the tax laws. They are entitled to clear explanations of the law and IRS procedures in all tax forms.</p>
<h2><strong>II. The Right to Quality Service <img class="alignright wp-image-3640 " src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/The-Protection-and-Fundamental-Rights-You-Have-with-the-IRS-The-Taxpayer-Bill-of-Rights-sfs-sfstax-jeffrey-schneider-now-what-help-mailbox-us-mail-1.jpg" alt="" width="523" height="407" /></strong></h2>
<p>Taxpayers have the right to receive prompt, courteous, and professional assistance in their dealings with the IRS, to be spoken to in a way they can easily understand, to receive clear and easily understandable communications from the IRS, and to have a way to file complaints about inadequate service.</p>
<h2><strong>III. The Right to Pay No More than the Correct Amount of Tax</strong></h2>
<p>Taxpayers have the right to pay only the amount of tax legally due and to have the IRS apply all tax payments properly.</p>
<h2><strong>IV. The Right to Challenge the IRS’ Position and Be Heard</strong></h2>
<p>Taxpayers have the right to raise objections and provide additional documentation in response to formal IRS actions or proposed actions, to expect that the IRS will fairly consider their timely objections and documentation promptly and fairly, and to receive a response if the IRS does not agree with their position.</p>
<h2><strong>V. The Right to Appeal an IRS Decision in an Independent Forum</strong></h2>
<p>Taxpayers are entitled to a fair and impartial administrative appeal of most IRS decisions, including many penalties, and have the right to receive a written response regarding the Office of Appeals’ decision. Taxpayers generally have the right to take their cases to court.</p>
<h2><strong>VI. The Right to Finality</strong></h2>
<p>Taxpayers have the right to know the maximum amount of time they have to challenge the IRS’s position, as well as the maximum amount of time the IRS has to audit a particular tax year or collect a tax debt. Taxpayers have the right to know when the IRS has finished an audit.</p>
<h2><strong>VII. The Right to Privacy <img class="alignright wp-image-3641 " src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/The-Protection-and-Fundamental-Rights-You-Have-with-the-IRS-The-Taxpayer-Bill-of-Rights-sfs-sfstax-jeffrey-schneider-now-what-help-key-padlock.jpg" alt="The Protection and Fundamental Rights You Have with the IRS, The Taxpayer Bill of Rights, sfs, sfstax, jeffrey schneider, now what help, key, padlock" width="590" height="494" /></strong></h2>
<p>Taxpayers have the right to expect that any IRS inquiry, examination, or enforcement action will comply with the law, be no more intrusive than necessary, and will respect all due process rights. This includes search and seizure protections and a collection due process hearing where applicable.</p>
<h2><strong>VIII. The Right to Confidentiality</strong></h2>
<p>Taxpayers have the right to expect that any information that they provide to the IRS will not be disclosed unless authorized by the taxpayer or by law. Taxpayers have the right to expect the IRS to investigate and take appropriate action against its employees, return preparers, and others who wrongfully use or disclose taxpayer return information.</p>
<h2><strong>IX. The Right to Retain Representation</strong></h2>
<p>Taxpayers have the right to retain an authorized representative of their choice to represent them in their dealings with the IRS. Taxpayers have the right to be told that, if they cannot afford to hire a representative, they may be eligible for assistance from a Low-Income Taxpayer Clinic.</p>
<h2><strong>X. The Right to a Fair and Just Tax System</strong></h2>
<p>Taxpayers have the right to expect the tax system to consider facts and circumstances that might affect their underlying liabilities, ability to pay, or ability to provide information in a timely manner. Taxpayers have the right to receive assistance from the Taxpayer Advocate Service if they are experiencing financial difficulty or the IRS has not resolved their tax issues properly and in a timely manner through its normal channels.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>“Not everyone is qualified to be a captain of a ship. When you’re miles from land and things get dicey, you want an Admiral, not a weekend sailor. You need a professional who knows what he or she is doing.”</strong></p>
<p>If your case gets remanded back to appeals, there are two other credentialed professionals that can represent you: the Certified Public Accountant and the Enrolled Agent.</p>
<p>Most tax return preparers provide outstanding service, however, they have differing levels of skill, as well as continuing education requirements and expertise.</p>
<p>Preparers with<strong> unlimited</strong> representation rights can represent their clients on any matters – including audits, payment collection issues, and appeals.</p>
<p>Preparers with<strong> limited</strong> representation rights can only represent clients whose returns they have prepared and signed.</p>
<h2><strong>Credentialed Return Preparers</strong></h2>
<p>Tax return preparers with <strong>unlimited</strong> rights include professionals with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enrolled Agents: Licensed by the IRS. Must pass a three-part Special Enrollment Examination. This is a comprehensive exam that requires them to demonstrate proficiency in federal tax planning, individual and business tax return preparation, and representation.</li>
<li>Attorneys: Licensed by state courts. Attorneys have earned a degree in law and have passed a bar exam. They may offer a range of services, and some specialize in tax preparation and planning.</li>
<li>Certified Public Accountants: Licensed by state courts. CPAs have passed the Uniform CPA Examination. They have completed a study of accounting at a college or university. They may offer a range of services, and some specialize in tax preparation and planning.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><img class="alignright wp-image-3539" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/The-Taxpayer-Representative-woman-sitting-desk-journal-note-taking-now-what-help-sfs-tax.jpg" alt="The Taxpayer Representative, woman, sitting, desk, journal, note taking, now what help, sfs tax" width="517" height="363" /></strong>If you are dealing with an audit, you cannot just walk into any tax return preparers’ office. Only an Enrolled Agent, a CPA, or an attorney can help you with an IRS issue.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>“Ask what those initials mean in the big scheme toward solving your problem. After all, you’ll be on the boat together and entrusting him or her with your financial life. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>You deserve to be certain you have the right one before you turn over the controls.” </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Where to Research for Preparers</strong></h2>
<p>The IRS has a searchable, sortable public directory at <a href="https://irs.treasury.gov/rpo/rpo.jsf">https://irs.treasury.gov/rpo/rpo.jsf</a> to search for various tax preparers.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Forget 10,000 Leagues Under the Sea. You’ll have to dive much deeper than that to get to the heart of the IRS.</strong></h2>
<p>When it comes to the administration and enforcement of our tax system, there are four basic levels:</p>
<h2><strong><img class="wp-image-3636 size-full alignright" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Chapter-Meme-B-1.jpg" alt="" width="526" height="526" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Chapter-Meme-B-1.jpg 526w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Chapter-Meme-B-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Chapter-Meme-B-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Chapter-Meme-B-1-500x500.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px" /></strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Examinations (Audits)</li>
<li>Collections</li>
<li>Appeals</li>
<li>Criminal Investigations</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s time to talk about the first three.</p>
<h2><strong>Examinations (Audits) </strong></h2>
<p>When a return is filed and processed, it is automatically deemed correct unless the IRS computers find an error.</p>
<h3><strong>What types of errors are picked up by the computers?</strong></h3>
<p>If you understate the income reported, overreport expenses, or report you had health insurance when you did not, the computer spits out a notice showing what they have compared to what you’ve put on your return.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you’ll get selected for audit (done locally or by mail). The auditor can pick up on these same errors or omissions.</p>
<h2><strong>Collections</strong></h2>
<p>The Internal Revenue Service is the world’s largest and most aggressive collection agency. Even with their funding woes, they can and will come after you (either in person or by mail <a href="https://sfstaxacct.com/2019/04/2019-dirty-dozen-list-of-tax-scams/">– never a phone call or email.</a>)</p>
<h2><strong><img class="alignright wp-image-3638 " src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/You-Have-It-We-Want-It-sfs-now-what-help-courtroom-courthouse-outside-2.jpg" alt="" width="427" height="645" /></strong></h2>
<p>One of the IRS collection units is the Automated Collections Service, or ACS. They have various service centers around the country. Then, there are Settlement Officers. These officials are usually in the IRS Appeals Office.</p>
<h2><strong>Appeals </strong></h2>
<p>A taxpayer usually gets one shot at appeals. The next step is to prepare and file a tax court petition. Generally, you can file this once you receive a 90-day notice (Statutory Notice of Deficiency.) You can prepare the petition:</p>
<ul>
<li>yourself</li>
<li>by a U.S. Tax Court Practitioner</li>
<li>by an attorney licensed to practice in your state</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, there is a $60 fee. You will wait until your petition gets on the court docket. Then, it is assigned to an IRS lawyer. Most of the time, IRS attorneys will “send it back to appeals,” because most cases are not USTC worthy (i.e. not enough money).</p>
<p>If you do not want to go to court (it is not cheap unless you do it yourself, and that is not highly recommended) and you cannot/do not pay, that is the crux of this book.</p>
<p>Just as you have the right to appeal an IRS decision, you also have the right to be represented.</p>

Schneider and How is He Qualified to Navigate the Murky Tax Seas?</strong></h1>
<p>The idea of receiving a letter from the IRS is not a pleasant one for anyone. What makes it worse is the confusion, the fear, the assumptions and the thoughts of all the worst-case scenarios that can make you feel like you have a tidal wave of stress.</p>
<h2><strong><img class="wp-image-3670 alignright" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Now-What-The-IRS-is-Taking-Everything-I-Own-Help-Florida-Treasure-Coast-Beachline-1.jpg" alt="Now What The IRS is Taking Everything I Own Help, Florida, Treasure Coast, Beachline" width="353" height="288" /></strong></h2>

<h2><strong>An EA is the only federally licensed tax professional. </strong></h2>

<h2><strong>Location </strong></h2>
<p>His practice is located on Florida’s Treasure Coast with a satellite office in Palm Beach. Jeff represents clients all over the country… because again, an Enrolled Agent is the <em>only </em>federally licensed tax pro!</p>

<p>In 2010, Jeff became a fellow of the National Tax Practice Institute. This program focuses solely on the many facets of representing taxpayers, individuals, and businesses before the IRS.</p>
<p>In 2015, he passed an advanced exam offered by the American Society of Tax Problem Solvers (ASTPS) to become a Certified Tax Resolution Specialist (CTRS).</p>
<p>Jeffrey A. Schneider EA, CTRS, NTPIF, ACT-E has earned the designation of Advanced Crypto Tax- Expert (ACT-E) from the Academy of Crypto Tax. He can help you or anyone you know (even if they are into “mining”) deal with the complicated tax implication of the Crypto World.</p>

<p>How long has it been? 3 years? More? 10? Some people have never filed taxes. Why not? <img class="alignright wp-image-3707 " src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Havent-Filed-Taxes-in-a-While-child-oops-shocked-face-tea-cup-1.jpg" alt="Haven't Filed Taxes in a While, child, oops, shocked face, tea cup" width="200" height="319" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“I knew I owed them, and I didn’t want to face the consequences.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“I couldn’t gather all of my records.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“My ex used to do them for me. I never learned how!”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“My accountant died.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“I’m in too deep.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“If I bring attention to the issue, the IRS is going to notice me and find things I never even <strong>realized</strong> I did wrong.”</em></p>
<h2><strong>Why Do We Have to File Tax Returns? </strong></h2>
<h2><strong><img class="alignright wp-image-3708 " src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Havent-Filed-Taxes-in-a-While-vacation-destination-beach-airplane-1.jpg" alt="" width="345" height="441" /></strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>It’s against the law not to file. This can be a felony… and you don’t it want following you the rest of your life.</li>
<li>If you’d like to buy or refinance a house, you need to prove that you’ve filed your returns.</li>
<li>If you want to get married one day, not filing can be a deal breaker because it carries <em>tons </em>of problems.</li>
<li>The IRS might file substitute-for-returns for you without deductions and you’ll owe them more than if you had just filed yourself.</li>
<li>If you owe $50,000 or more, your passport privileges will be revoked by the IRS. This means you can’t escape to Mexico before getting caught.</li>
<li>If you’re self-employed, you might miss out on increased Social Security contributions for when you retire.</li>
<li>You’re required to have filed to obtain health insurance.</li>
<li>You won’t be able to get student loan aid for your kids (FAFSA)</li>
<li>It will reduce your chances of having your identity stolen.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Do I Need to File Every Year?</strong></h2>
<p>Not typically, no. The IRS wants to see your last seven years of returns on file. However, if the IRS filed for you, you’ll want to replace the Substitute for Returns with returns of your own to reduce the balance they assessed. If you’re getting refunds and won’t owe taxes, you only have to worry about the last 4 years.</p>
<h2><strong>Alright, This is Too Much</strong></h2>
<p>Your Enrolled Agent will take thorough information on your tax situation and can handle this for you. Jeffrey A. Schneider EA, CTRS, NTPIF, ACT-E can determine exactly the number of years that need to be filed. He can find out whether the IRS has filed for you or not, find out whether or not you’ll be getting refunds that you may be entitled to, and set you up for future success.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>$458 Owed in Back Taxes&#8230;The IRS Are On Their Way!</strong></h2>
<p>If you thought you were getting away from the IRS before… apparently so did everybody else. The IRS is on a mission to collect nearly $500 billion owed in back taxes, and they’re not going to stop until they get every penny.</p>
<p>And get this – if you still run and hide – interest now accrues DAILY, not monthly!</p>
<h4><strong>What does this MEAN?</strong></h4>
<p><img class="wp-image-1697 alignleft" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/458-Billion-Debt-Owed-The-IRS-Are-on-Their-Way-chaos-paperwork-man-giving-up.jpg" alt="" width="169" height="234" /></p>
<p>“You’re paying interest on interest on interest every day,” said IRS national taxpayer advocate Nina Olson. “The worst thing you can do if you have a debt is do nothing at all.”</p>
<p>It may be time to meet with an Enrolled Agent to review your federal tax payments. An experienced EA can pull your IRS transcripts, analyze the findings, and let you know where you stand.</p>
<p>The IRS has much more power than ever before. In fact, Pete Sepp – president of the <a href="https://www.ntu.org/">National Taxpayers Union</a> &#8211; claims, “The IRS has a huge suite of tools to get taxpayers to pay back taxes and some of those tools are very blunt.”</p>
<h4><strong>What will they DO?</strong></h4>
<p>The IRS WILL seize property, garnish your wages and take legal action by all means necessary.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-1696 alignright" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/458-Billion-Debt-Owed-The-IRS-are-on-their-way-passport-revoked-travel-irs.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="210" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/458-Billion-Debt-Owed-The-IRS-are-on-their-way-passport-revoked-travel-irs.jpg 4000w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/458-Billion-Debt-Owed-The-IRS-are-on-their-way-passport-revoked-travel-irs-300x209.jpg 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/458-Billion-Debt-Owed-The-IRS-are-on-their-way-passport-revoked-travel-irs-768x536.jpg 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/458-Billion-Debt-Owed-The-IRS-are-on-their-way-passport-revoked-travel-irs-1024x715.jpg 1024w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/458-Billion-Debt-Owed-The-IRS-are-on-their-way-passport-revoked-travel-irs-700x489.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>It’s definitely time to be proactive (if we can even still use that word). Have you heard about the IRS’s new <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2018-07-06/hundreds-of-thousands-at-risk-for-passport-denial-because-of-tax-debt">passport revocation abilities</a>? We have learned that around 362,000 Americans with unpaid tax debts will not be able to apply for or renew passports until their debts are settled. The law now actually <strong>requires</strong> the IRS and the State to deny or revoke passports for people who have an overdue tax debt of $51k or more.</p>
<h4><strong>How do I fix this?</strong></h4>
<p>Fixing your debts becomes absolutely crucial when the IRS holds as much power as they now do. Contact your <a href="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/media/">enrolled agent</a>; they have the means necessary to fix your tax and debt issues before things begin to get messy.</p>

<p class="p1">Mail, Phone, Email or Facebook&#8230;How Does the IRS Contact Taxpayers? When the IRS needs to contact a taxpayer, the first contact is normally by letter delivered by the U.S. Postal Service. The IRS doesn&#8217;t normally initiate contact with taxpayers by email, nor does it send text messages or contact through social media channels.</p>
<p class="p1">Depending on the situation, IRS employees may first call or visit with a taxpayer. In some instances, advance notice is provided in writing via a letter or notice, but not always.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>IRS Phone Calls</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">IRS revenue officers work directly with taxpayers to educate them about their options to resolve delinquencies and to collect delinquent taxes and tax returns while protecting taxpayers&#8217; rights.</li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1"> </span>IRS revenue agents or tax compliance officers may call a taxpayer or tax professional after mailing a notice to confirm an appointment or to discuss items for a scheduled audit.</li>
<li class="li1">Private debt collectors can call taxpayers for the collection of certain outstanding inactive tax liabilities but only after the taxpayer and their representative have received written notice. <span class="s2">Private debt collectors</span> for the IRS must respect taxpayers&#8217; rights and abide by the consumer protection provisions of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><b>IRS Visits</b></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span>IRS revenue officers routinely make unannounced visits to a taxpayer’s home or place of business to discuss taxes owed, delinquent tax returns or a business falling behind on payroll tax deposits. IRS revenue officers will request payment of taxes owed by the taxpayer; however, payment will never be requested to a source other than the US Treasury.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1"> </span>IRS revenue agents usually visit taxpayers or tax professionals to conduct the audit after either mailing a notice and/or agreeing on the day and time. IRS revenue agents will sometimes make unannounced visits to a taxpayer’s home or place of business to discuss a tax matter.</li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1"> </span>IRS criminal investigators are federal law enforcement agents who may visit a taxpayer’s home or place of business unannounced while conducting an investigation. They will not demand any sort of payment.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><b>Ask For Credentials</b></p>
<p class="p1">IRS representatives can always provide two forms of official credentials: a pocket commission and a <a href="http://links.govdelivery.com:80/track?type=click&amp;enid=ZWFzPTEmbWFpbGluZ2lkPTIwMTcwODAyLjc2NTc0NjYxJm1lc3NhZ2VpZD1NREItUFJELUJVTC0yMDE3MDgwMi43NjU3NDY2MSZkYXRhYmFzZWlkPTEwMDEmc2VyaWFsPTE3MTQ5NTIwJmVtYWlsaWQ9YWxpQHNmc3RheGFjY3QuY29tJnVzZXJpZD1hbGlAc2ZzdGF4YWNjdC5jb20mZmw9JmV4dHJhPU11bHRpdmFyaWF0ZUlkPSYmJg==&amp;&amp;&amp;129&amp;&amp;&amp;https://www.fedidcard.gov/"><span class="s2">Personal Identity Verification Credential (PIV)</span></a>. Pocket commissions describe the specific authority and responsibilities of the authorized holder. The PIV is a government-wide standard for secure and reliable forms of identification for federal employees and contractors. Criminal investigators also have a badge and law enforcement credentials.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Paying Taxes</b></p>
<p class="p1">All tax payments are to the U.S. Treasury. Taxpayers should never use a preloaded debit card or wire transfer to make a payment. The IRS provides specific guidelines on how to make a tax payment at <a href="http://links.govdelivery.com:80/track?type=click&amp;enid=ZWFzPTEmbWFpbGluZ2lkPTIwMTcwODAyLjc2NTc0NjYxJm1lc3NhZ2VpZD1NREItUFJELUJVTC0yMDE3MDgwMi43NjU3NDY2MSZkYXRhYmFzZWlkPTEwMDEmc2VyaWFsPTE3MTQ5NTIwJmVtYWlsaWQ9YWxpQHNmc3RheGFjY3QuY29tJnVzZXJpZD1hbGlAc2ZzdGF4YWNjdC5jb20mZmw9JmV4dHJhPU11bHRpdmFyaWF0ZUlkPSYmJg==&amp;&amp;&amp;130&amp;&amp;&amp;https://www.irs.gov/payments"><span class="s2">irs.gov/payments</span></a>.</p>
<p class="p1">IRS employees and contractors will never:</p>
<p><span class="s1">g• </span>Be hostile or insulting</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">Demand payment without giving taxpayers the opportunity to question or appeal the amount</li>
<li class="li1">Require a specific payment method, such as a prepaid debit card</li>
<li class="li1">Threaten lawsuits, arrest, deportation or other action for not paying</li>
<li class="li1">Ask for credit or debit card numbers over the phone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mail, Phone, Email or Facebook&#8230;How Does the IRS Contact Taxpayers? If you have any questions call your tax professional or reach out to Jeffrey Schneider, EA, CTRS, NTPIF at SFS Tax Problem Solutions</p>
<p class="p1">Avoid scams. The IRS never initiates contact using social media or text messages. The first contact generally comes in the mail.  A special page on IRS.gov, “<a href="http://links.govdelivery.com:80/track?type=click&amp;enid=ZWFzPTEmbWFpbGluZ2lkPTIwMTcwODAyLjc2NTc0NjYxJm1lc3NhZ2VpZD1NREItUFJELUJVTC0yMDE3MDgwMi43NjU3NDY2MSZkYXRhYmFzZWlkPTEwMDEmc2VyaWFsPTE3MTQ5NTIwJmVtYWlsaWQ9YWxpQHNmc3RheGFjY3QuY29tJnVzZXJpZD1hbGlAc2ZzdGF4YWNjdC5jb20mZmw9JmV4dHJhPU11bHRpdmFyaWF0ZUlkPSYmJg==&amp;&amp;&amp;131&amp;&amp;&amp;https://www.irs.gov/uac/newsroom/how-to-know-it-s-really-the-irs-calling-or-knocking-on-your-door"><span class="s2"><i>How to know it’s really the IRS calling or knocking on your door</i></span></a>,”  helps taxpayers determine if a person claiming to be from the IRS is legitimate or an imposter.</p>
