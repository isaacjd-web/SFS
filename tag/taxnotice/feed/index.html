			<p>If you are under audit from the IRS or in receipt of a notice of additional tax due, the steps you take next could make all the difference. There is a strong temptation to ignore these communications, however, doing nothing will not make the IRS go away. Indeed, the longer you wait, the more dire the situation will become.</p>
<p>Every day you wait is one more day the IRS will tack on fees, penalties, and additional interest. Before you make the situation worse, it is time to face the problem head on, even if that means hiring a tax resolution professional.</p>
<p>There are plenty of reasons to consider a tax resolution professional, especially if you do not have the money to pay what you owe. You may also want to consult a tax resolution professional if you disagree with the determination, or if you are confused by what the IRS is claiming. If you find that hiring a tax resolution firm is the right move, here are some key things to look for.</p>
<p>As an expert Tax Resolution Firm ourselves, we encourage all readers facing a tax problem to contact us for a free consultation either by phone at 877-355-8010 or email Marissa our office manager at <a href="mailto:marissa@sfstaxacct.com">marissa@sfstaxacct.com</a></p>
<h2>Skilled and Qualified Professionals</h2>
<p>The quality of the professional you receive will be directly impacted by the knowledge of the individuals who work there. The best tax resolution companies go out of their way to hire real experts, including men and women who have spent time working for the IRS.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3898 size-full" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/handshake-sfs.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/handshake-sfs.jpg 1000w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/handshake-sfs-300x200.jpg 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/handshake-sfs-768x512.jpg 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/handshake-sfs-700x467.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>This insider knowledge is hard to beat, and it is one of the key things to look for when hiring a tax resolution professional. Look for employees who spent time in the trenches, working directly on tax law, auditing and other related fields.</p>
<p>Relevant Experience<br />
Deep experience is critical when hiring a tax resolution professional. The tax code is extremely complicated, and it gets longer with every year. Look for individuals with relevant experience in all aspects of tax law, from ferreting out fraud to defending taxpayers who have simply made honest mistakes.</p>
<p>Always ask about the expertise and experience of the people who work for the tax resolution firm. Things like the longevity of service, background, and training can be pivotal, and they could tip the scales in favor of one tax resolution professional over another.</p>
<h2>The Availability of Specialists</h2>
<p>Not all tax situations are the same. The small business owner who receives a surprise tax bill will have different needs, and different questions, than a single mom.</p>
<p>When hiring a tax resolution professional, it is important to look for specialists who can help with your unique situation. Interview the company representative carefully, placing special emphasis on what you are expecting and what you would consider a fair resolution with the IRS.</p>
<h2>Deep Knowledge of Tax Resolution</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3899 size-full" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/books-sfs.jpg" alt="" width="796" height="340" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/books-sfs.jpg 796w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/books-sfs-300x128.jpg 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/books-sfs-768x328.jpg 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/books-sfs-700x299.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 796px) 100vw, 796px" />The U.S. tax code is anything but static; the government is constantly making changes. Those changes can have a profound impact on how much employees pay in taxes, the size of the refunds they receive and if their deductions will be approved.</p>
<p>When hiring a tax resolution professional, look for deep knowledge of not just tax law, but the programs available to resolve your tax problem. Continuing education in tax resolution specifically is a big deal for tax resolution professionals, and it is something you should insist on when interviewing potential providers.</p>
<p>No one likes to deal with the IRS, and sometimes you need some help in doing so. Whether you receive an audit notice or find a tax bill in your mailbox, you need to take steps to protect yourself and your money. A tax resolution professional can negotiate with the IRS on your behalf, potentially saving you money and helping you avoid legal and financial penalties. Knowing what to look for in such a service can help you get the most for your money, so you can stay on the good side of the IRS.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Oh No! The IRS Sent a Tax Notice</h2>
<p>The moment you take an IRS Notice from your mailbox, it&#8217;s time to open it and call an enrolled agent immediately. A tax professional will be able to guide you through the process of resolving your tax problem and place you in the best possible light in front of the IRS.</p>
<h2><strong>The Scary Stuff</strong></h2>
<p>If you don’t take action now, the IRS &#8211; which is the world’s largest and most aggressive collection agency &#8211; could cause incredible hardships down the road. You can&#8217;t bury your head in the sand once you receive the notice. Have you heard of tax liens and tax levies? The IRS uses these two methods to collect their dues. Taxpayers must fix their problems quickly and voluntarily.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Tax Liens</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">A tax lien is a claim on your property. If your tax debt exceeds $10,000, the IRS issues a &#8220;secret – or silent &#8211; lien&#8221; because even though at first there is no public record, it attaches to all of your property and rights to property — both real estate and personal property — as of the date the tax is assessed.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For example, a tax is assessed against you on July 1st and you give the property to a third party as a gift on July 2nd. The tax lien continues to be attached to that property, even though you had no prior knowledge of the existence of the tax lien. The person who received the property didn&#8217;t know that the tax lien had arisen!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class=" wp-image-1841 alignleft" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/What-to-do-when-the-IRS-sends-a-tax-notice-bank-conference-crisis-financial-debt.jpg" alt="" width="366" height="227" />When most taxpayers or tax professionals refer to a tax lien, they are actually referring to a &#8220;Notice of Federal Tax Lien&#8221; (NFTL). An NFTL is a document filed in a public place, such as a county recorder&#8217;s office or with the Secretary of State. It is a notice to the world that you owe taxes. A Notice of Federal Tax Lien lists the amount of the taxes owed, the type of tax, and even the years for which taxes are owed.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Notice of Federal Tax Lien may even be picked up by the various credit reporting agencies, and may cause significant credit problems. At this point, don&#8217;t sell any property you own. Your property equity will go directly to the IRS.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Tax Levies</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">A levy is the IRS collecting a debt you owe through the seizure of your property; be it cash (bank) or wages (garnishment). A tax levy is not available for the general public to see. It also does not affect your credit rating by itself or prevent you from selling your property. However, if the IRS serves a tax levy on your bank, the bank is <strong>required</strong> to send all your money to the IRS up to the amount of the tax debt. The bank will then notify you of its receipt of the tax levy. After that, you&#8217;ll have 21 calendar days to negotiate with the IRS to try and convince them to release it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If the IRS sends a tax levy to your employer, your employer is required to send the required amount to the IRS and because there is no 21-day holding period, the tax levy is effective starting with the very first paycheck you receive after the employer receives the tax levy. In addition, there is no holding period. If you find out the IRS has served a tax levy on your employer, it is extremely important to contact a qualified enrolled agent. He or she will begin immediate negotiations with your employer before your next paycheck. Your bank and your employer will forward your money to the IRS. Once that happens, it is very hard to get them back.</p>
<h5><em>An Impeding Feeling of Doom</em></h5>
<p>The IRS can seize assets such as wages, bank accounts, social security benefits, and retirement income. The IRS may also seize and sell your property to satisfy the tax debt. This includes your car, boat, real estate, etc. <em>Ouch.</em> In addition, any future federal tax refunds will be used to pay off the debt. Even state income tax refunds that you&#8217;re due may be seized and applied to your federal tax liability.<br />
If the IRS sent a tax notice, it’s absolutely crucial that you get help from an enrolled agent. He or she will help you move forward and prevent the IRS from creating such hardships.</p>
<h2><strong>A Fresh Start for All</strong><img class="wp-image-1842 alignright" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/What-to-do-when-the-IRS-sends-a-tax-notice-girl-jumping-fence-happy.jpg" alt="" width="386" height="233" /></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/new-irs-fresh-start-initiative-helps-taxpayers-who-owe-taxes">IRS Fresh Start program</a> makes it easier for taxpayers and even small businesses to pay back taxes and avoid tax liens. If the IRS sent a tax notice, you should know the features of and consider the Fresh Start program:</p>
<h5>• <strong>Tax Liens</strong></h5>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Fresh Start program increased the amount that taxpayers can owe to $10,000. The IRS generally will file a Notice of Federal Tax Lien once the taxpayer surpasses that. However, in some cases, the IRS may still file a lien notice on amounts less than $10,000.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Some taxpayers may qualify to have their lien notice withdrawn if they are paying their tax debt through a Direct Debit Installment Agreement. However, if a taxpayer defaults on the Direct Debit Installment Agreement, the IRS may file a new Notice of Federal Tax Lien and resume collection actions.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A taxpayer must meet certain requirements and pays off their tax debt. After that, the IRS may withdraw the Notice of Federal Tax Lien. Taxpayers must request this in writing, and we can help with this.</p>
<h5><strong>• Installment Agreements.</strong></h5>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Fresh Start program expanded access to streamlined installment agreements. Now, individual taxpayers who owe up to $50,000 can pay monthly direct debit payments for up to six years. They are also able to pay up to when the collection statutes expire &#8211; 10 years from the date the tax was assessed. While the IRS generally will not need a financial statement, they may need some financial information from the taxpayer. Your enrolled agent can collect and submit this for you.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Taxpayers in need of installment agreements for tax debts more than $50,000 or longer than six years still need to provide the IRS with a financial statement.</p>
<h5><strong>• Offers in Compromise.<img class=" wp-image-1843 alignright" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/What-to-do-when-the-IRS-sends-a-tax-notice-an-offer-in-compromise-dad-and-son-walking.jpg" alt="" width="260" height="254" /></strong></h5>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">An Offer in Compromise (OIC) allows taxpayers to settle their tax debt for less than the full amount. Fresh Start expanded and streamlined the OIC program. If approved, the IRS accepts a lesser amount – sometimes even just a fraction of what’s owed – to settle your debt. It isn’t always easy to gain approval (less than 40% was accepted in 2016). The IRS considers your income, assets, expenses, ability to pay, and potential hardship. However, the IRS now has more flexibility when analyzing a taxpayer’s ability to pay. This makes the offer program available to a larger group of taxpayers.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Generally, the IRS will accept an offer if it&#8217;s the most the agency can expect to collect within a reasonable period of time. The IRS will not accept an offer if the taxpayer can pay the amount owed in full.</p>
<h2><strong>Avoiding a Lien</strong></h2>
<p>You can avoid a federal tax lien by simply filing and paying all your taxes in full and on time. If you can’t file or pay on time, don’t ignore the letters or correspondence you get from the IRS. If the IRS sent a tax notice, Jeffrey Schneider, EA, CTRS is ready to help provide payment options that are available to help you settle your tax debt over time.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><em>You Got a Tax Notice. You Cannot Run or Hide, So Now What? What to Do When the IRS Wants Something from You. An SFS Tax Problem Solutions Blog.</em></p>
<p>So you got a tax notice. Plan your next move very, very carefully. It’s like playing a game of chess.</p>
<p>However, you have to actually play.</p>
<h3><strong>Got a Tax Notice? Open It!</strong></h3>
<p>We’ve covered this before, but it bears repeating: The absolute worst thing you can do is to do nothing.</p>
<p>The first notice the IRS sends is the opening call. They are asking for you to take an action or to provide more information… and they expect a response. If you don’t give them one, they will escalate to the next level.</p>
<p>Eventually, you can be hit with a huge tax bill including interest and penalties. You can get a lien placed on your social security number, attaching to all of your property. You can have your wages levied. You can even be hauled into tax court and hit with a jail sentence. Don’t let any of this happen to you!</p>
<p>All of these negative outcomes are preventable. As long as you take the first step by opening the notice.</p>

<h3><strong>Got a Tax Notice? Seek Professional Help</strong></h3>
<p>It is advisable to get an Enrolled Agent to assist you with the handling this notice. As America’s Tax Expert,® an Enrolled Agent (EA) has been down this road many times. He or she can assess your situation and work toward the best possible outcome.</p>
<h3><strong>Got a Tax Notice? Proceed with Caution</strong></h3>
<p>Choosing to handle your own IRS problems can leave you vulnerable to many pitfalls.</p>
<p>“As previously mentioned, a tax professional will be able to guide you through this process and place you in the best possible light. But, if you want to handle it yourself, it is best to give the IRS exactly what they ask, nothing more,” advised Jeffrey Schneider, EA, CTRS, NTPI Fellow in his book, <em>Now What? I Got a Tax Notice from the IRS. Help! </em></p>
<p>Well-meaning folks can cost themselves thousands of dollars by revealing too much.</p>
<p>And that’s just one potential problem that can arise if you choose to go it alone.</p>
<h3><strong>Got a Tax Notice? There are Options Available to You</strong></h3>
<p>Let’s say you legitimately owe the IRS money… and you legitimately can’t pay it. There are ways to mitigate your tax debt or to manage it so that you can still live your life while dealing with it.</p>
<p>An EA can analyze past tax years to see if you were due a refund (or a bigger refund) that can offset your debt. Or, he or she can help you apply for an Installment Agreement or an Offer in Compromise.</p>
<p>And all is not lost if the IRS has already put a tax lien or levy on your property or wages. An EA can get you back into good standing with the IRS.</p>
<p>It’s definitely not as bad as it may seem when that tax notice first shows up in the mailbox!</p>
<p>Yes, there is hope… no matter what your situation is.</p>
