			<p>You may have heard on the radio, T.V., and online, that you can settle your tax bill for less than what you owe. But are these claims really true? And can you settle your tax debt without hurting yourself in the long run?</p>
<p>Some of the national tax resolution firms you hear advertising offer minimal service, take a look at their Google and Yelp Reviews. So, it&#8217;s essential to know who you can trust and educate yourself on what your options are available to resolve your tax problem.</p>
<p>SFS Tax Problem Solutions is a specialty tax resolution firm. We encourage all of our readers that are facing a tax problem or know someone that is to contact us for a complimentary consultation.</p>
<p>The truth is that it&#8217;s often way more complicated than these big companies claim to negotiate a settlement for less than you owe the IRS, but it is possible. You must first learn if you qualify for the program. The program is known as an &#8220;offer in compromise,&#8221; but settling is not necessarily a bad thing.</p>
<p>An &#8220;offer in compromise&#8221; is a negotiated settlement between the taxpayer and the IRS that is intended to help taxpayers who owe more than they can pay. In many cases, you can settle your entire tax bill for a fraction of what you owe, if you qualify. You can only qualify if you genuinely can&#8217;t afford to pay back taxes or if doing so would cause extreme hardship. (i.e., if you have become disabled).</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-3907 size-medium" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/104a-tax-form-300x216.png" alt="" width="300" height="216" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/104a-tax-form-300x216.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/104a-tax-form.png 548w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />You also must be current on all legally required income tax returns and any estimated tax payments that you are required to make if you are self-employed. Nor can you be filing for bankruptcy.</p>
<p>The IRS would prefer to take an offer in compromise than send you to collections and potentially get less money. Taking an offer in compromise will NOT affect your credit score. Having your offer in compromise accepted is a far better financial decision in the long run.</p>
<p>However, working out what offer to make on your own and learning the whole process can be extremely challenging. That&#8217;s like representing yourself in a court of law without a lawyer. Not smart. A better answer is to find a tax resolution specialist that can help you with the process to see if you qualify and determine what you will have to pay. A CTRS, Certified Tax Resolution Specialist tax resolution specialist will also be a licensed CPA, Enrolled Agent, or an Attorney.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of working with a qualified and local tax resolution firm is that you get protection from the overbearing IRS. Whereby you will sleep better at night knowing you&#8217;re on your way towards a permanent tax solution. Additionally, the tax resolution expert can head-off any impending garnishments of your paycheck or levies on your bank account.</p>
<p>Settling with the IRS is a good thing and is often the best answer to dealing with your back-tax bill and moving on with your life.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-3908 size-medium" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2019-taxpayer-roadmap-300x296.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="296" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2019-taxpayer-roadmap-300x296.jpg 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2019-taxpayer-roadmap.jpg 611w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />If you want an expert tax resolution professional who knows how to navigate the IRS maze, reach out to our firm, and we&#8217;ll schedule a no-obligation confidential consultation to explain your options to resolve your tax problem permanently.</p>

			<p>If you are under audit from the IRS or in receipt of a notice of additional tax due, the steps you take next could make all the difference. There is a strong temptation to ignore these communications, however, doing nothing will not make the IRS go away. Indeed, the longer you wait, the more dire the situation will become.</p>
<p>Every day you wait is one more day the IRS will tack on fees, penalties, and additional interest. Before you make the situation worse, it is time to face the problem head on, even if that means hiring a tax resolution professional.</p>
<p>There are plenty of reasons to consider a tax resolution professional, especially if you do not have the money to pay what you owe. You may also want to consult a tax resolution professional if you disagree with the determination, or if you are confused by what the IRS is claiming. If you find that hiring a tax resolution firm is the right move, here are some key things to look for.</p>
<p>As an expert Tax Resolution Firm ourselves, we encourage all readers facing a tax problem to contact us for a free consultation either by phone at 877-355-8010 or email Marissa our office manager at <a href="mailto:marissa@sfstaxacct.com">marissa@sfstaxacct.com</a></p>
<h2>Skilled and Qualified Professionals</h2>
<p>The quality of the professional you receive will be directly impacted by the knowledge of the individuals who work there. The best tax resolution companies go out of their way to hire real experts, including men and women who have spent time working for the IRS.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3898 size-full" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/handshake-sfs.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/handshake-sfs.jpg 1000w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/handshake-sfs-300x200.jpg 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/handshake-sfs-768x512.jpg 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/handshake-sfs-700x467.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>This insider knowledge is hard to beat, and it is one of the key things to look for when hiring a tax resolution professional. Look for employees who spent time in the trenches, working directly on tax law, auditing and other related fields.</p>
<p>Relevant Experience<br />
Deep experience is critical when hiring a tax resolution professional. The tax code is extremely complicated, and it gets longer with every year. Look for individuals with relevant experience in all aspects of tax law, from ferreting out fraud to defending taxpayers who have simply made honest mistakes.</p>
<p>Always ask about the expertise and experience of the people who work for the tax resolution firm. Things like the longevity of service, background, and training can be pivotal, and they could tip the scales in favor of one tax resolution professional over another.</p>
<h2>The Availability of Specialists</h2>
<p>Not all tax situations are the same. The small business owner who receives a surprise tax bill will have different needs, and different questions, than a single mom.</p>
<p>When hiring a tax resolution professional, it is important to look for specialists who can help with your unique situation. Interview the company representative carefully, placing special emphasis on what you are expecting and what you would consider a fair resolution with the IRS.</p>
<h2>Deep Knowledge of Tax Resolution</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3899 size-full" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/books-sfs.jpg" alt="" width="796" height="340" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/books-sfs.jpg 796w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/books-sfs-300x128.jpg 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/books-sfs-768x328.jpg 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/books-sfs-700x299.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 796px) 100vw, 796px" />The U.S. tax code is anything but static; the government is constantly making changes. Those changes can have a profound impact on how much employees pay in taxes, the size of the refunds they receive and if their deductions will be approved.</p>
<p>When hiring a tax resolution professional, look for deep knowledge of not just tax law, but the programs available to resolve your tax problem. Continuing education in tax resolution specifically is a big deal for tax resolution professionals, and it is something you should insist on when interviewing potential providers.</p>
<p>No one likes to deal with the IRS, and sometimes you need some help in doing so. Whether you receive an audit notice or find a tax bill in your mailbox, you need to take steps to protect yourself and your money. A tax resolution professional can negotiate with the IRS on your behalf, potentially saving you money and helping you avoid legal and financial penalties. Knowing what to look for in such a service can help you get the most for your money, so you can stay on the good side of the IRS.</p>
<p>If you want an expert tax resolution professional who knows how to navigate the IRS maze, reach out to our firm and we’ll schedule a no-obligation confidential consultation to explain your options to permanently resolve your tax problem. https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/contact-us-at-sfs-tax-problem-solutions-in-port-st-lucie/</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5>Hello, my fellow taxpayers,</h5>
<p>I am writing this email on Thursday night, while I watch the Yankees play the A&#8217;s. Right now, they are winning 2-0, thanks to an Aaron Judge home run. By the time you read this, we will know if your friendly neighborhood Enrolled Agent will be depressed or ready for the Red Sox on Friday night.</p>
<p>In any case, it really is just a game and it does not have any effect on me personally. What I&#8217;m getting at is&#8230; don&#8217;t sweat the small stuff. We all have so much going on in our daily lives, we should fight the battles that need to be fought.</p>
<p>I will have to remember that as I watch the rest of the Wild Card Playoff game.</p>
<p>Who am I kidding? If the Yankee lose, my baseball season is over and I will be a basket case.</p>
<p>So until next time.</p>
<p>C Ya</p>
