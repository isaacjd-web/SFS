			<h4>F is for First Time Penalty Abatement</h4>
<ul>
<li>The first time penalty abatement (FTA) waiver is an administrative waiver that the IRS may grant to relieve taxpayers from failure-to-file, failure-to-pay and failure-to-deposit penalties if certain criteria are met.</li>
<li>The IRS also removes interest related to those penalties.</li>
</ul>
<p>First Time Penalty Abatement is an option that may be available to taxpayers to remove IRS penalties that have been assessed to a tax debt. However, not everyone qualifies for penalty abatement. Also, not all penalties are eligible for penalty abatement. Some of the most common penalties that are able to be abated are failure to file, failure to pay, and failure to deposit estimated tax.</p>
<h5>You may qualify for administrative relief from penalties for failing to file a tax return, pay on time, and/or to deposit taxes when due under the IRS First Time Penalty Abatement policy if you meet the following:</h5>
<ul>
<li>A taxpayer didn’t previously have to file a return, or you have no penalties for the 3 tax years prior to the tax year in which you received a penalty.</li>
<li>You filed all currently required returns or filed an extension of time to file.</li>
<li>You have paid, or arranged to pay, any tax due.</li>
</ul>
<p>The failure-to-pay penalty will continue to accrue, until the tax is paid in full. It may be to your advantage to wait until you fully pay the tax due prior to requesting penalty relief under the Service&#8217;s first-time penalty abatement policy. The penalty is 5% of your balance per month.</p>
<p>Interest charged on a penalty will be reduced or removed when that penalty is reduced or removed. If an unpaid balance remains on your account, interest will continue to accrue until the account is full paid.</p>
<p>Other administrative relief: If you received incorrect oral advice from the IRS, you may qualify for administrative relief.</p>
<p>Determining whether a situation or event qualifies a taxpayer for penalty relief can be tricky. Seeking professional help from an Enrolled Agent and Certified Tax Resolution Specialist is helpful not only because the tax professional is familiar with the qualifications for penalty abatement, but also, they will know how to properly organize and submit your request.  Discover how to solve your tax problem by speaking with us today. <a href="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/media/"> Find out more about me</a>.

Here’s What to Do.</strong></h1>
<p>The IRS takes unpaid payroll taxes seriously. These are some of the worst kind of back taxes you can owe. If you’re a small business owner with payroll tax problems, read on to learn what you can do to avoid the IRS crippling your business or worse, shut your business down completely.</p>
<p>And why would they do this? When you withhold taxes from employees’ checks, it is not yours. Not paying taxes is considered stealing.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-3674 " src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Small-Business-Owner-Owe-Payroll-Taxes-Here’s-What-to-Do-stressed-man-pay-phone-calling-making-phone-call-1.jpg" alt="Small Business Owner, Owe Payroll Taxes, Here’s What to Do, stressed, man, pay phone, calling, making phone call" width="510" height="497" /></p>
<h2><strong>Why Small Business Owners Get Into Payroll Tax Trouble In The First Place</strong></h2>
<p>It’s hard being a small business owner today, trying to pay your employees their paychecks every week, and pay the IRS all those payroll taxes.</p>
<p>A lot of times when money is short, you pay the employees first. You need to be able to take care of them even if it means not paying yourself.  If nothing else, the process of having to find new employees is a pain – don’t make them quit on you!</p>
<p>It can seem easy to “just pay it next pay period” and give yourself a little cash flow cushion, but skipping paying your employees payroll tax deposits is never a good idea.</p>
<p>What happens too often is one pay period turns into 2, and 3, and 4, and eventually you’re so deep in payroll tax debt that the only thing you want to do is completely ignore your problem.</p>
<p>The IRS doesn’t care if you can’t pay your employees.  They don’t care if they put your employees out on the street. It just doesn’t matter if you can’t collect your receivables.  They don’t care if one of your largest and best customers just went “belly-up”. You have money that belongs to them and they will do whatever they have to. They’ll put you out of business to collect it. They don’t care who you are or what business you are in.</p>
<h2><strong>Penalties are The Kiss Of Death When It Comes to Back Payroll Taxes</strong></h2>
<p>Penalties for failing to file and pay your payroll taxes are the “kiss of death” for any small business owner. They tack on penalties totaling 33% in just the first 16 days! And it doesn’t stop there.  The IRS adds interest on top of the penalties too. It is not uncommon that a payroll tax liability doubles in short order. And if you don’t pay them or work something out, they will shut you down. Why would a Revenue Officer want to work out an arrangement with you when shutting your business down is much less work?</p>
<h2><strong><img class="wp-image-3164 aligncenter" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Small-Business-Owner-Owe-Payroll-Taxes-Here’s-What-To-Do-chart-federal-tax-deposit-penalties.jpg" alt="Small Business Owner Owe Payroll Taxes Here’s What To Do, chart, federal tax deposit penalties" width="828" height="242" /></strong></h2>
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>The IRS Will Collect or They Will Shut You Down</strong></h2>
<p>It’s as simple as that.  The IRS is the most brutal collection agency on the planet.  They have more authority than the President of the United States. Therefore, they have all the ways and means to do whatever it takes to collect what’s owed to them. Even though you certainly didn’t expect to be short in funds, you weren’t avoiding payroll taxes because you didn’t want to. The money simply wasn’t there.  It’s not your fault.  One week you’re short of cash.  It was a slow week, a customer’s check bounced, or any number of legitimate reasons that just prevent you from paying the IRS.  The next week comes and goes, and you realize you still don’t have enough money to make that payroll tax deposit.  And then the entire situation starts “snow-balling” into an avalanche.</p>
<h2><strong>Should You Call The IRS To Get Your Payroll Issue Fixed? <img class="alignright wp-image-3675 " src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Small-Business-Owner-Owe-Payroll-Taxes-Here’s-What-to-Do-stress-colored-pencil-writing-red-1.jpg" alt="Small Business Owner, Owe Payroll Taxes, Here’s What to Do, stress, colored pencil, writing, red" width="488" height="362" /></strong></h2>
<p>If you were to call the IRS, and were able to get through after waiting on “hold” for an hour or more, and try to explain your situation—you might as well have a conversation with the wall—because they don’t care.  The IRS representative that you’re talking to probably makes less than $20 an hour, isn’t properly equipped to handle too many issues.  These representatives have probably never made a payroll in their life. Do you think they know what it’s like running a small business? Do you really think they will have any sympathy for you?</p>
<p>Not only is the answer “NO” but they can also dictate the fate of your case. What they will try to get, while you’re on the phone, is all your personal and financial information.  They want to know where you bank; they’ll want to know all about your customers who owe you money, they’ll want to know about the value of all your assets, like your home, cars, motorcycles, etc. Why? Because now they have all the information they need to levy your bank accounts, take your receivables and seize your property.</p>
<p>Plus, customer service is a misnomer. You are not their customer, the government is!</p>
<p>Now that you know you shouldn’t be talking to the IRS because they are not going to help you, you might be wondering what you should do?  Where should you turn for help?  They smartest thing you can do to protect your business and family is to have someone represent you—someone who deals with the IRS for a living. You need to get help from an experienced tax expert. An Enrolled Agent deals with the IRS every day, helping small business owners keep their businesses and settle IRS payroll tax problems.</p>
<h2><strong>Find a Resolution</strong></h2>
<p>Jeffrey Schneider EA, CTRS, NTPIF, ACT-E steps into your shoes and protects you from the IRS’s abusive tactics. He takes over all communications from the IRS on your behalf. Once they realize you have someone on your side protecting you, who knows their tricks as well as they do, they have to step back and follow the law.  Not only can he protect you from the IRS harassing you and showing up at your front door, he can get those penalties reduced and in some cases completely removed!</p>
<p>If you can’t pay on time, don’t ignore the letters or correspondence you get from the IRS. Reach out to us and we’ll schedule a no-obligation confidential consultation to explain your options to permanently resolve your tax problem. You can avoid a federal tax lien by simply filing and paying all your taxes in full and on time.</p>

<p>How long has it been? 3 years? More? 10? Some people have never filed taxes. Why not? <img class="alignright wp-image-3707 " src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Havent-Filed-Taxes-in-a-While-child-oops-shocked-face-tea-cup-1.jpg" alt="Haven't Filed Taxes in a While, child, oops, shocked face, tea cup" width="200" height="319" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“I knew I owed them, and I didn’t want to face the consequences.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“I couldn’t gather all of my records.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“My ex used to do them for me. I never learned how!”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“My accountant died.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“I’m in too deep.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“If I bring attention to the issue, the IRS is going to notice me and find things I never even <strong>realized</strong> I did wrong.”</em></p>
<h2><strong>Why Do We Have to File Tax Returns? </strong></h2>
<h2><strong><img class="alignright wp-image-3708 " src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Havent-Filed-Taxes-in-a-While-vacation-destination-beach-airplane-1.jpg" alt="" width="345" height="441" /></strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>It’s against the law not to file. This can be a felony… and you don’t it want following you the rest of your life.</li>
<li>If you’d like to buy or refinance a house, you need to prove that you’ve filed your returns.</li>
<li>If you want to get married one day, not filing can be a deal breaker because it carries <em>tons </em>of problems.</li>
<li>The IRS might file substitute-for-returns for you without deductions and you’ll owe them more than if you had just filed yourself.</li>
<li>If you owe $50,000 or more, your passport privileges will be revoked by the IRS. This means you can’t escape to Mexico before getting caught.</li>
<li>If you’re self-employed, you might miss out on increased Social Security contributions for when you retire.</li>
<li>You’re required to have filed to obtain health insurance.</li>
<li>You won’t be able to get student loan aid for your kids (FAFSA)</li>
<li>It will reduce your chances of having your identity stolen.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Do I Need to File Every Year?</strong></h2>
<p>Not typically, no. The IRS wants to see your last seven years of returns on file. However, if the IRS filed for you, you’ll want to replace the Substitute for Returns with returns of your own to reduce the balance they assessed. If you’re getting refunds and won’t owe taxes, you only have to worry about the last 4 years.</p>
<h2><strong>Alright, This is Too Much</strong></h2>
<p>Your Enrolled Agent will take thorough information on your tax situation and can handle this for you. Jeffrey A. Schneider EA, CTRS, NTPIF, ACT-E can determine exactly the number of years that need to be filed. He can find out whether the IRS has filed for you or not, find out whether or not you’ll be getting refunds that you may be entitled to, and set you up for future success.</p>

<p>Though our firm specializes in helping people resolve their IRS or state back tax problems, we also love saving you money. After all, one of the best ways to avoid getting into tax trouble is to minimize your liabilities.</p>
<h2><strong><img class="alignright wp-image-2683" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Year-End-Tax-Saving-Strategies-girl-writing-sticky-notes.jpg" alt="" width="374" height="223" /></strong></h2>
<p>The end of the year is the perfect time to review your finances and the perfect time to make some smart tax-saving moves. Making the right moves at the end of the year can possibly reduce your tax liability and allow you to keep more of what you earn.</p>
<p>From accelerating expenses to boosting the amount you put away for retirement, there are things you can do to lower your tax burden. You may not be able to control the tax fight in Washington, but you can limit the amount you pay by assessing your own tax situation and making some prudent changes.</p>
<h2><strong>Accelerate Your Expenses</strong></h2>
<p>Individual taxpayers are on the cash basis for income tax purposes. This means your income is taxable when you receive it and expenses count when you pay them. Depending on your situation, shifting deductions between years can make a big difference on your tax bill. With this knowledge, making additional deductible payments prior to the end of the year may be a good idea. Examples include property tax payments, mortgage interest payments, and charitable donations.</p>
<h2><strong>Boost Your 401(k) Contributions </strong></h2>
<h2><strong><img class="alignright wp-image-2684" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Year-End-Tax-Saving-Strategies-girl-writing-white-board.jpg" alt="Year-End Tax Saving Strategies, girl, writing, white board" width="604" height="903" /></strong></h2>
<p>As the year ticks down to its close, it pays to look at your most recent pay stub and see how much you have already contributed to your 401(k) plan. Contributing to a 401(k) plan is an excellent way to save on taxes since every dollar you put in is deducted from your taxable income.</p>
<p>For 2018, you can contribute up to $18,500 to your 401(k) plan, plus an extra 6,000  if you are 50 or older. Also, if you have not yet maxed out your 401(k), now is the perfect time to boost your contributions and make up for lost time.  Keep in mind that many companies allow you to change your contribution percentage any time you wish. Boosting the amount you put in between now and the end of the year can make a huge difference. You can adjust your contribution downward in the new year if you wish, but at least consider leaving it at its new elevated level.</p>
<h2><strong>Gather Your Donations</strong></h2>
<p style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 200%; font-family: 'Microsoft Sans Serif','sans-serif';">Donating to charity makes you feel good, but it can also be good for your wallet. If you itemize your deductions, you may be able to take a deduction for not only cash contributions but gifts of household goods and clothing as well.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 200%; font-family: 'Microsoft Sans Serif','sans-serif';">Take a few minutes this weekend to go through your closets and storage areas. First, look for usable items you no longer need. Box them up and take them down to your local thrift store or other charity. Be sure to get a receipt that shows what you donated, along with the approximate value. </span></p>
<h2><strong>Contact Your Enrolled Agent</strong></h2>
<p style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 200%; font-family: 'Microsoft Sans Serif','sans-serif';">This is a short list of some of the ideas you can use to lower your tax obligation in 2018. If you need an expert tax resolution professional, reach out to us and we’ll schedule a no-obligation confidential consultation. Jeffrey Schneider, EA, CTRS will explain your options and help permanently resolve your tax problem.</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>$458 Owed in Back Taxes&#8230;The IRS Are On Their Way!</strong></h2>
<p>If you thought you were getting away from the IRS before… apparently so did everybody else. The IRS is on a mission to collect nearly $500 billion owed in back taxes, and they’re not going to stop until they get every penny.</p>
<p>And get this – if you still run and hide – interest now accrues DAILY, not monthly!</p>
<h4><strong>What does this MEAN?</strong></h4>
<p><img class="wp-image-1697 alignleft" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/458-Billion-Debt-Owed-The-IRS-Are-on-Their-Way-chaos-paperwork-man-giving-up.jpg" alt="" width="169" height="234" /></p>
<p>“You’re paying interest on interest on interest every day,” said IRS national taxpayer advocate Nina Olson. “The worst thing you can do if you have a debt is do nothing at all.”</p>
<p>It may be time to meet with an Enrolled Agent to review your federal tax payments. An experienced EA can pull your IRS transcripts, analyze the findings, and let you know where you stand.</p>
<p>The IRS has much more power than ever before. In fact, Pete Sepp – president of the <a href="https://www.ntu.org/">National Taxpayers Union</a> &#8211; claims, “The IRS has a huge suite of tools to get taxpayers to pay back taxes and some of those tools are very blunt.”</p>
<h4><strong>What will they DO?</strong></h4>
<p>The IRS WILL seize property, garnish your wages and take legal action by all means necessary.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-1696 alignright" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/458-Billion-Debt-Owed-The-IRS-are-on-their-way-passport-revoked-travel-irs.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="210" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/458-Billion-Debt-Owed-The-IRS-are-on-their-way-passport-revoked-travel-irs.jpg 4000w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/458-Billion-Debt-Owed-The-IRS-are-on-their-way-passport-revoked-travel-irs-300x209.jpg 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/458-Billion-Debt-Owed-The-IRS-are-on-their-way-passport-revoked-travel-irs-768x536.jpg 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/458-Billion-Debt-Owed-The-IRS-are-on-their-way-passport-revoked-travel-irs-1024x715.jpg 1024w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/458-Billion-Debt-Owed-The-IRS-are-on-their-way-passport-revoked-travel-irs-700x489.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>It’s definitely time to be proactive (if we can even still use that word). Have you heard about the IRS’s new <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2018-07-06/hundreds-of-thousands-at-risk-for-passport-denial-because-of-tax-debt">passport revocation abilities</a>? We have learned that around 362,000 Americans with unpaid tax debts will not be able to apply for or renew passports until their debts are settled. The law now actually <strong>requires</strong> the IRS and the State to deny or revoke passports for people who have an overdue tax debt of $51k or more.</p>
<h4><strong>How do I fix this?</strong></h4>
<p>Fixing your debts becomes absolutely crucial when the IRS holds as much power as they now do. Contact your <a href="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/media/">enrolled agent</a>; they have the means necessary to fix your tax and debt issues before things begin to get messy.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You’ve probably heard someone who represents himself has a fool for a client. This is just as true when it comes to the IRS as it is in a criminal court.</p>
<p>If you’re in trouble with the IRS, you need an Enrolled Agent. Here’s why:</p>
<h2><strong>Enrolled Agent is the Highest Credential Issued by the IRS</strong></h2>
<p>Enrolled agents are the only federally licensed tax practitioners who specialize in taxation and can represent clients before all levels of the IRS.</p>
<p>They can also represent taxpayers – businesses or individuals – in any state and in any tax matter.</p>
<p>The Enrolled Agent (EA) is the most expansive license the IRS grants.</p>
<p>There’s no substitute for an EA!</p>

Here's What You Need" width="477" height="318" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cable-call-communication-33999-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cable-call-communication-33999-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cable-call-communication-33999-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cable-call-communication-33999-1-700x467.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 477px) 100vw, 477px" />Enrolled Agents have the Expertise You Need</strong></h3>
<p>EAs face stringent qualifications to earn their designation.</p>
<p>Candidates must pass a rigorous background check, conducted by the IRS.</p>
<p>They have to either have been employed by the IRS for five years or pass the SEE (Special Enrollment Exam). This three-part, comprehensive tax code test is administered by the <a href="https://www.naea.org/">National Association of Enrolled Agents (NAEA)</a>. It covers individual and business tax returns, tax representation and practice and procedure.</p>
<p>Enrolled agents have gone beyond the basic tax preparer requirements. They have demonstrated expertise in the field of taxes.</p>
<h3><strong>Enrolled Agents Stay Current on the Ever-Changing Tax Laws</strong></h3>
<p>EAs must also complete 72 hours of education courses every three years.</p>
<p>Members of the NAEA face an even higher standard. They must complete 90 hours each three year period.</p>
<p>Attorneys and CPAs may or may not specialize in taxation. All Enrolled Agents do.</p>
<p>EAs eat, breathe and live taxes!</p>
<h3><strong>Enrolled Agents who are Members of the NAEA adhere to a Code of Ethics</strong></h3>
<p>NAEA members must adhere to a stringent Code of Ethics and Rules of Professional Conduct. They belong to a strong network of experienced, well-trained tax professionals, effectively representing their clients and working to make the tax code fair and reasonably enforced.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">Mail, Phone, Email or Facebook&#8230;How Does the IRS Contact Taxpayers? When the IRS needs to contact a taxpayer, the first contact is normally by letter delivered by the U.S. Postal Service. The IRS doesn&#8217;t normally initiate contact with taxpayers by email, nor does it send text messages or contact through social media channels.</p>
<p class="p1">Depending on the situation, IRS employees may first call or visit with a taxpayer. In some instances, advance notice is provided in writing via a letter or notice, but not always.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>IRS Phone Calls</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">IRS revenue officers work directly with taxpayers to educate them about their options to resolve delinquencies and to collect delinquent taxes and tax returns while protecting taxpayers&#8217; rights.</li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1"> </span>IRS revenue agents or tax compliance officers may call a taxpayer or tax professional after mailing a notice to confirm an appointment or to discuss items for a scheduled audit.</li>
<li class="li1">Private debt collectors can call taxpayers for the collection of certain outstanding inactive tax liabilities but only after the taxpayer and their representative have received written notice. <span class="s2">Private debt collectors</span> for the IRS must respect taxpayers&#8217; rights and abide by the consumer protection provisions of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><b>IRS Visits</b></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1"> </span>IRS revenue officers routinely make unannounced visits to a taxpayer’s home or place of business to discuss taxes owed, delinquent tax returns or a business falling behind on payroll tax deposits. IRS revenue officers will request payment of taxes owed by the taxpayer; however, payment will never be requested to a source other than the US Treasury.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1"> </span>IRS revenue agents usually visit taxpayers or tax professionals to conduct the audit after either mailing a notice and/or agreeing on the day and time. IRS revenue agents will sometimes make unannounced visits to a taxpayer’s home or place of business to discuss a tax matter.</li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1"> </span>IRS criminal investigators are federal law enforcement agents who may visit a taxpayer’s home or place of business unannounced while conducting an investigation. They will not demand any sort of payment.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><b>Ask For Credentials</b></p>
<p class="p1">IRS representatives can always provide two forms of official credentials: a pocket commission and a <a href="http://links.govdelivery.com:80/track?type=click&amp;enid=ZWFzPTEmbWFpbGluZ2lkPTIwMTcwODAyLjc2NTc0NjYxJm1lc3NhZ2VpZD1NREItUFJELUJVTC0yMDE3MDgwMi43NjU3NDY2MSZkYXRhYmFzZWlkPTEwMDEmc2VyaWFsPTE3MTQ5NTIwJmVtYWlsaWQ9YWxpQHNmc3RheGFjY3QuY29tJnVzZXJpZD1hbGlAc2ZzdGF4YWNjdC5jb20mZmw9JmV4dHJhPU11bHRpdmFyaWF0ZUlkPSYmJg==&amp;&amp;&amp;129&amp;&amp;&amp;https://www.fedidcard.gov/"><span class="s2">Personal Identity Verification Credential (PIV)</span></a>. Pocket commissions describe the specific authority and responsibilities of the authorized holder. The PIV is a government-wide standard for secure and reliable forms of identification for federal employees and contractors. Criminal investigators also have a badge and law enforcement credentials.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Paying Taxes</b></p>
<p class="p1">All tax payments are to the U.S. Treasury. Taxpayers should never use a preloaded debit card or wire transfer to make a payment. The IRS provides specific guidelines on how to make a tax payment at <a href="http://links.govdelivery.com:80/track?type=click&amp;enid=ZWFzPTEmbWFpbGluZ2lkPTIwMTcwODAyLjc2NTc0NjYxJm1lc3NhZ2VpZD1NREItUFJELUJVTC0yMDE3MDgwMi43NjU3NDY2MSZkYXRhYmFzZWlkPTEwMDEmc2VyaWFsPTE3MTQ5NTIwJmVtYWlsaWQ9YWxpQHNmc3RheGFjY3QuY29tJnVzZXJpZD1hbGlAc2ZzdGF4YWNjdC5jb20mZmw9JmV4dHJhPU11bHRpdmFyaWF0ZUlkPSYmJg==&amp;&amp;&amp;130&amp;&amp;&amp;https://www.irs.gov/payments"><span class="s2">irs.gov/payments</span></a>.</p>
<p class="p1">IRS employees and contractors will never:</p>
<p><span class="s1">g• </span>Be hostile or insulting</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">Demand payment without giving taxpayers the opportunity to question or appeal the amount</li>
<li class="li1">Require a specific payment method, such as a prepaid debit card</li>
<li class="li1">Threaten lawsuits, arrest, deportation or other action for not paying</li>
<li class="li1">Ask for credit or debit card numbers over the phone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mail, Phone, Email or Facebook&#8230;How Does the IRS Contact Taxpayers? If you have any questions call your tax professional or reach out to Jeffrey Schneider, EA, CTRS, NTPIF at SFS Tax Problem Solutions</p>
<p class="p1">Avoid scams. The IRS never initiates contact using social media or text messages. The first contact generally comes in the mail.  A special page on IRS.gov, “<a href="http://links.govdelivery.com:80/track?type=click&amp;enid=ZWFzPTEmbWFpbGluZ2lkPTIwMTcwODAyLjc2NTc0NjYxJm1lc3NhZ2VpZD1NREItUFJELUJVTC0yMDE3MDgwMi43NjU3NDY2MSZkYXRhYmFzZWlkPTEwMDEmc2VyaWFsPTE3MTQ5NTIwJmVtYWlsaWQ9YWxpQHNmc3RheGFjY3QuY29tJnVzZXJpZD1hbGlAc2ZzdGF4YWNjdC5jb20mZmw9JmV4dHJhPU11bHRpdmFyaWF0ZUlkPSYmJg==&amp;&amp;&amp;131&amp;&amp;&amp;https://www.irs.gov/uac/newsroom/how-to-know-it-s-really-the-irs-calling-or-knocking-on-your-door"><span class="s2"><i>How to know it’s really the IRS calling or knocking on your door</i></span></a>,”  helps taxpayers determine if a person claiming to be from the IRS is legitimate or an imposter.</p>
