<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Seth Rogen Launches “Houseplant” – A Cannabis Company</strong></h1>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-3653 " src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Seth-Rogen-Launches-Houseplant-A-Cannabis-Company-plant-cannabusiness-1.jpg" alt="" width="325" height="507" /></p>
<p>Comedian Seth Rogen and filmmaker Evan Goldberg are getting into the recreational cannabis business. On Wednesday, March 27<sup>th</sup>, they announced the launch of their brand <a href="https://www.houseplant.com/">Houseplant</a> in Canada. The new company is a partnership with global cannabis firm <a href="https://www.canopygrowth.com/investors/news-releases/canopy-growth-welcomes-houseplant-to-the-family/">Canopy Growth</a> and will “make it easier for people to learn to love cannabis as much as Houseplant does,” according to a press release from the company.</p>
<p>“Houseplant is a passion we’ve brought to life through drive and dedication,” <a href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/welcome-to-houseplant-an-elevated-canadian-cannabis-company-866891919.html">said Rogen</a>, a longtime <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/cannabis/">cannabis</a> advocate and star of the movies “Pineapple Express” and “Superbad,” both collaborations with Goldberg. “Every decision we’ve made for the business reflects the years of education, first-hand experience, and respect we have for cannabis.”</p>
<h2><strong>Mark Zekulin</strong><strong>, President and Co-CEO of Canopy Growth, expressed high hopes for the future of the new company. </strong></h2>
<p>“We have been getting to know the Houseplant team for quite a while now and continue to be impressed by their understanding of the cannabis consumer, attention to detail, and drive towards their vision,” said Zekulin. “We could not be more excited to partner with them and work towards our shared goal of making Houseplant one of the largest cannabis brands in the world.”</p>
<p>Canopy Growth will bring its advanced production infrastructure and research capabilities to the partnership, supporting the vision of Houseplant. Canopy Growth is a leading producer of cannabis and cannabis products in Canada. It has operations in 12 countries on five continents. The company also has a marketing arrangement with hip-hop icon Snoop Dogg. Furthermore, they recently announced a new line of hemp CBD products developed in collaboration with homemaker extraordinaire and media mogul Martha Stewart.</p>
<h2><strong>Three Strains on the Way </strong></h2>
<p>Houseplant plans to release three cannabis strains “designed to satisfy both expert and new users” in Canada in the upcoming months. They&#8217;re hoping “to ensure an intuitive shopping and consuming experience for customers.” The first, Houseplant Sativa, will be available beginning next month through provincially regulated retailers and online in British Columbia. It will be followed by Houseplant Hybrid and Houseplant Indica, with each strain having its own easily identifiable design.</p>

<p>The company will soon offer dried cannabis flower, soft-gel <a href="https://hightimes.com/health/what-exactly-are-thc-pills/">capsules</a>, and pre-rolled joints nationwide and will be operated in Toronto. Houseplant “is dedicated to quality, education, guidance, and elevation of cannabis to enhance the lives of Canadians.”</p>
<p>“We are so proud to be launching in Canada, our home,” said Goldberg. “After spending five years diligently preparing for the launch of this company, we’re excited to be able to share our passion for cannabis with Canadians in this way.”</p>
