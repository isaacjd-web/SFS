								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>April 15<sup>th</sup> is now well behind us. If you didn’t file your tax return (or file for an extension), a CP59 notice from the IRS may soon be appearing in a mailbox near you.</p>
<h3><strong>How Do I Know I Got a CP59 Notice from the IRS? </strong></h3>
<p>In the upper right-hand corner of the first page the type of notice you are receiving with be listed. It will also tell you what tax year the notice is for, the date of the notice, your social security number, a phone number to call as well as a caller ID.</p>
<h3><strong><img class="size-medium wp-image-1244 alignright" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Now-What-I-Got-a-CP59-Notice-from-the-IRS-Help-SFS-Tax-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-CP59-Notice-IRS-Tax-Notice-IRS-Notice-Tax-Notice-225x300.png" alt="Now What, I Got a CP59 Notice from the IRS, Help, SFS Tax, SFS Tax Problem Solutions, CP59 Notice, IRS Tax Notice, IRS Notice, Tax Notice" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Now-What-I-Got-a-CP59-Notice-from-the-IRS-Help-SFS-Tax-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-CP59-Notice-IRS-Tax-Notice-IRS-Notice-Tax-Notice-225x300.png 225w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Now-What-I-Got-a-CP59-Notice-from-the-IRS-Help-SFS-Tax-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-CP59-Notice-IRS-Tax-Notice-IRS-Notice-Tax-Notice.png 555w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" />Why am I Getting this CP59 Notice? </strong></h3>
<p>The message of this notice is simple: You didn’t file your return and now you need to do so. The IRS has a reason to believe that you meet the requirements for filing an income tax return… and they have not received it as of the date of the notice.</p>
<h3><strong>What do I Need to do with a CP59 Notice? </strong></h3>
<p>You will need to do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><u>File your return as soon as possible</u>. Use the envelope provided with the CP59 Notice and include payment if you owe taxes. It’s best to have an Enrolled Agent (EA) or other tax professional help you prepare the return so that you don’t pay more than you need to.</li>
<li><u>Explain to the IRS why you don’t need to file</u>. This can be done using the response form provided with the notice or via the phone number provided on the notice. However, your Enrolled Agent (EA) can help you communicate this to the IRS.</li>
<li><u>Explain why you are filing late</u>. The IRS will want to know why you didn’t file on time. Again, we recommend having a tax professional help you with this communication.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hey, things happen… especially if you mailed your return. It may have gotten lost or been delayed. So if you’ve already filed, you’ll need to let the IRS know this. You can use the response form provided with the notice to do this. You’ll need to include a signed and dated copy of the return.</p>
<h3><strong>What if I Don’t Agree with the Notice? </strong></h3>
<p>If you disagree with the notice, call the IRS at the toll-free number. An IRS contact number is included for you at the top right-hand corner of the notice.</p>
<p>If you are in doubt about what to do for any reason, an EA can help you determine the best course of action.</p>
