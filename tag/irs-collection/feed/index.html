								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are statutes of limitations on IRS collection activity. Of course, if you deliberately file a false tax return to evade paying the correct tax, all bets are off. The IRS can attempt to collect from you forever.</p>
<p>Don’t give up hope, though.</p>
<p>There are ways to stall the IRS so that you may continue living your life – at least temporarily.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1309 size-full" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/How-Do-You-Get-the-IRS-Off-Your-Back-Temporarily-SFS-Tax-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Monkey-Eating-Monkey-off-the-Back-Appeasing.png" alt="" width="904" height="503" srcset="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/How-Do-You-Get-the-IRS-Off-Your-Back-Temporarily-SFS-Tax-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Monkey-Eating-Monkey-off-the-Back-Appeasing.png 904w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/How-Do-You-Get-the-IRS-Off-Your-Back-Temporarily-SFS-Tax-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Monkey-Eating-Monkey-off-the-Back-Appeasing-300x167.png 300w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/How-Do-You-Get-the-IRS-Off-Your-Back-Temporarily-SFS-Tax-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Monkey-Eating-Monkey-off-the-Back-Appeasing-768x427.png 768w, https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/How-Do-You-Get-the-IRS-Off-Your-Back-Temporarily-SFS-Tax-SFS-Tax-Problem-Solutions-Monkey-Eating-Monkey-off-the-Back-Appeasing-700x389.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 904px) 100vw, 904px" /></p>
<p>These include:</p>
<h3><strong>Filing an Offer in Compromise</strong></h3>
<p>With an offer in compromise, you offer to settle your tax debt for less than you owe. Sounds simple, but it’s far from it.</p>
<p><strong> </strong>Offers in compromise require a complete financial disclosure on your part. From there, the IRS will “assign” living expenses to you (which can often be less than what you are paying now).</p>
<p>With a complete picture of your finances in place, the IRS determines how much they can expect to get from you over the time they have to collect.</p>
<p>If they feel they can collect more than what you’re offering, you won’t get your offer accepted.</p>
<p>However, submitting an offer in compromise can suspend IRS collection activity while the IRS considers it. How long will that be? It can take six to 12 months to get a decision.</p>

<h3><strong>Applying for an Installment Agreement</strong></h3>
<p>When you file for an installment agreement, you are asking the IRS to let you repay your tax debt over time.</p>
<p>Submitting an installment agreement will suspend collection activity while the IRS is making its decision.</p>
<p>If it’s accepted, the IRS won’t try to collect from you as long as you are making your payments as agreed and on time.</p>
<h3><strong>Bankruptcy</strong></h3>
<p>If you file for bankruptcy, collection activity will cease during the proceedings. However, if your tax debt is not completely discharged, the IRS can resume collections six months after you are out of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Other ways to stall IRS collection activity include: appealing a Collection Due decision, applying for Innocent Spouse Relief, and filing a Taxpayer Assistance Order.</p>
<p>An Enrolled Agent can walk you through your options. Your EA can also help you settle your tax debt, in some cases for less than you owe. If you’re facing IRS trouble, it’s a good idea to consult with an experienced and knowledgeable EA.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are all sorts of misconceptions about the IRS. One of the bigger ones is regarding collection (and other) time limits.</p>
<p>Most people think the IRS has just 10 years to collect its tax debt from you. In most cases, that’s true, but there is much confusion about when that 10 years starts and ends. And (of course) there are exceptions to that 10-year rule as well.</p>
<p>Lest you be lulled into a false sense of security, here are the current rules on IRS collection time limits.</p>
<h3><strong>Three Years to Claim a Refund</strong></h3>
<p>You have the following amount of time to claim a refund with the IRS:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have three years from the date you originally filed your tax return to claim a refund OR</li>
<li>Within two years from the date you paid the tax, whichever is later</li>
</ul>
<p>Naturally, the limit on receiving a refund is the shortest time limitation the IRS has.</p>
<p>It’s a good idea to enlist the help of an Enrolled Agent to review your return. Why? Because you may not know all the deductions you can take.</p>
<p>Many times we’ve found errors or unclaimed deductions while reviewing tax returns. This applies whether individuals filed them on their own or with another preparer. Sometimes those errors and omissions could have turned a debt into a refund, or a small refund into a larger one.</p>
<p>You aren’t stuck with the return you originally filed, either.</p>
<p>As long as the time limit has not been reached, you can file an amended return and get the refund you are entitled to.</p>

<h3><strong>Three to Six Years (or Forever) to be Audited </strong></h3>
<p>Sound a little nebulous? We thought so.</p>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of the IRS time limits on audits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The IRS has three years from the date you filed your tax return to begin an audit, UNLESS</strong></li>
<li><strong>You omitted over 25% of your income, capital gains and other forms of income. In that case, the IRS time limit is six years; OR</strong></li>
<li><strong>You omitted over $5,000 in foreign income – interest and gains included. If this is true, the IRS has six years to conduct an audit, AND </strong></li>
<li><strong>There is a precedent for a 30-year audit in a case where a business owner was held responsible for payroll tax penalties, AND</strong></li>
<li><strong>If you don’t file a return, there is no time limit on audits AND </strong></li>
<li><strong>There is also no time limit if you do not file certain tax forms, such as a Form 5471 for a controlled foreign corporation</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Ten Years to Collect </strong></h3>
<p>The IRS generally has 10 years to collect a tax debt – from the time the debt was assessed.</p>
<p>Didn’t file a return? No tax has been assessed yet. (Now the IRS can use the information it has on hand about you to file a return and then assess tax on that return).</p>
<p>How do you figure out, then, on what date was the tax assessed?</p>
<p>Look at the first notice you receive from the IRS. The date on that notice is when the clock starts ticking.</p>
<p>Again, if you don’t file, the clock never starts ticking.</p>
<p>Therefore, not filing and hiding under a rock for 10 years isn’t going to help you.</p>
<p>Here are more exceptions to this ten-year collection period:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It can be extended if you agree to do so. </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you enter into an installment agreement, for example, you will most likely have to sign a waiver of the 10-year collection limit. This extension is limited to six years, however.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The IRS can sue to extend the deadline.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This is a rare occurrence, but it is still an option available to the IRS.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It can drag on for more than 10 years if the collection period is temporarily suspended. </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>For example, you are in a disaster area (this happens more in Florida than you would think). During that time, the IRS may suspend its collection activity toward you. Don’t worry, though. They’ll be sure to pick it up again once that designation is lifted.</p>
<p>Other events that could cause a temporary suspension of the collection period are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bankruptcy</li>
<li>Submitting an installment agreement</li>
<li>Submitting an offer in compromise</li>
<li>A request for innocent spouse relief</li>
<li>If you live outside of U.S. borders for six months or more</li>
</ul>

<p>Filing (and paying) your taxes correctly, on time, is the best defense against an audit and/or IRS collection activity.</p>
<p>If you are unable to pay your tax debt in full when it’s due, there are options to take so that you remain in good standing with the IRS.</p>
<p>Remember that an Enrolled Agent can analyze your returns to see if you are entitled to a refund. He or she can also advise you of the best course of action should you have to deal with the IRS.</p>
<p>It’s always better to have the right information and the best advice when it comes to the IRS!</p>
