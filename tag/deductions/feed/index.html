<p>Have you looked into medical expenses lately? No worries, we’ve got you covered! They <strong>are </strong>on the rise – increasing by about $1,000 this year for an average family of four according to the Milliman Medical Index.</p>
<p>Allow us to assist further by providing some options to help you save:</p>
<p><strong>Contribute to a Health Savings Account (HSA)</strong></p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-1642 alignright" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/If-Your-Heart-Is-Still-Beating-Your-Medical-Bills-Are-Increasing-key-glasses-wallet.jpg" alt="" width="224" height="274" /></p>
<p>If you have a high deductible health plan, consider opening an HSA to pay your medical bills. As long as your health insurance deductible is $1,350.00 ($2,700.00 for family) or more, you can make contributions up to $3,450.00 ($6,900.00 for family) for 2018.</p>
<p><strong>Contribute to a Flexible Savings Account (FSA)</strong></p>
<p>Your employer can arrange an FSA for you, where both you and your employer can make pre-tax payroll contributions to the account to cover certain medical expenses.</p>
<p>Pros: Your total annual election amount is available to you on January 1<sup>st</sup></p>
<p>Cons: If you don’t use your FSA dollars by year-end, you lose the funds</p>
<p><strong>Deduct Self-Employed Health Insurance Premiums</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=" wp-image-1643 alignleft" src="https://isaacjd-web.github.io/SFS/sfs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/If-Your-Heart-Is-Still-Beating-Your-Medical-Bills-Are-Increasing-Hand-Vision.jpg" alt="" width="198" height="246" /></strong></p>
<p>As long as you are self-employed, you can deduct amounts paid for health insurance for both you and your family. Your business must reflect profit for the tax year in order to qualify. This is an above-the-line deduction, so it can reduce your taxable income even if you are claiming the standard deduction.</p>
<p><strong>Deduct Medical Expenses as an Itemized Deduction</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>In 2018, the IRS is allowing itemized deductions for medical expenses that exceed 7.5% of your adjusted gross income (AGI). For the average household income per US Census Bureau’s guidelines of $60,000, any medical expenses above $4,500 can be written off as long as you are not taking the standard deduction.</p>
<p><strong>Obtain Qualified Health Coverage</strong></p>
<p>The individual shared responsibility mandate is still in place for 2018. If you don’t have qualified health coverage, you may be accountable for a hefty fee when you file your taxes.</p>
